"1170","GiveWell’s Top Charities Are (Increasingly) Hard to Beat","<p><em>In this post, &ldquo;we&rdquo; refers to Good Ventures and the <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/who-we-are"">Open Philanthropy Project,</a> who work as partners.</em></p>

<p>Our <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy"">thinking on prioritizing across different causes</a> has evolved as we&rsquo;ve made more grants. This post explores one aspect of that: the high bar set by the best global health and development interventions, and what we&rsquo;re learning about the relative performance of some of our other grantmaking areas that seek to help people today. To summarize:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When we were getting started, we used unconditional cash transfers to people living in extreme poverty (a program run by <a href=""https://www.givedirectly.org"">GiveDirectly</a>) as &ldquo;the bar&rdquo; for being willing to make a grant, on the grounds that such giving was quite cost-effective and likely extremely scalable and persistently available, so we should not generally make grants that we expected to achieve less benefit per dollar than that. Based on the roughly 100-to-1 ratio of average consumption between the average American and GiveDirectly cash transfer recipients, and a logarithmic model of the utility of money, we call this the &ldquo;100x bar.&rdquo; So if we are giving to, e.g., encourage policies that increase incomes for average Americans, we need to increase them by $100 for every $1 we spend to get as much benefit as just giving that $1 directly to GiveDirectly recipients. <a href=""#extremepoverty"">More</a>.</li>
	<li>GiveWell (<a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/who-we-are"">which we used to be part of and remain closely affiliated with</a>) has continued to find more and larger opportunities over time, and <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2019/02/07/how-givewells-research-is-evolving/"">become more optimistic about finding more cost-effective ones in the future</a>. This has the implication that we should raise &ldquo;the bar&rdquo; to something closer to the current estimated cost-effectiveness of GiveWell&rsquo;s unfunded top charities, which they believe to be in the range of 5-15x more cost-effective than 100x cash transfers, meaning a bar of benefits 500-1,500 times the cost of our grants (which we approximate to a &ldquo;1,000x bar&rdquo;). <a href=""#bestprograms"">More.</a></li>
	<li>Since adopting cash transfers as the relevant benchmark for our giving aimed at <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy"">helping people alive today</a>, we&rsquo;ve given ~$100M in U.S. policy, ~$100M in scientific research, and ~$300M based on GiveWell recommendations. According to our extremely rough internal calculations, we do expect many of our grants in scientific research and U.S. policy to exceed the &ldquo;100x bar&rdquo; represented by unconditional cash transfers, but relatively few to clear a &ldquo;1,000x bar&rdquo; roughly corresponding to high-end estimates for GiveWell&rsquo;s unfunded top charities. This would imply that it&rsquo;s quite difficult/rare for work in these categories to look more cost-effective than GiveWell&rsquo;s top charities. However, these calculations are extraordinarily rough and uncertain. <a href=""#peopletoday"">More.</a></li>
	<li>In spite of these calculations, we think there are some good arguments to consider in favor of our current grantmaking in these areas. <a href=""#counterconsiderations"">More</a>.</li>
	<li>We continue to think it is likely that there are causes aimed at helping people today (potentially including our current ones) that could be more cost-effective than GiveWell&rsquo;s top charities, and we are <a href=""https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/openphilanthropyorg/view/P_AAAAAAFAACuGJXzLj5l5Sp?trackingTag=openPhilanthropyWebsite"">hiring researchers</a> to work on finding and evaluating them. <a href=""#shouldbe"">More</a>.</li>

<h2><a id=""extremepoverty"" name=""extremepoverty""></a>Cash transfers to people in extreme poverty</h2>

<p>In 2015, when we were still part of GiveWell, <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/25/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later/#Benchmark"">we wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>By default, we feel that any given grant of $X should look significantly better than <strong>making direct cash transfers (totaling $X) to people who are extremely low-income by global standards</strong> &ndash; abbreviated as &ldquo;direct cash transfers.&rdquo; We believe it will be possible to give away very large amounts, at any point in the next couple of decades, via direct cash transfers, so any grant that doesn&rsquo;t meet this bar seems unlikely to be worth making&hellip;.<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s possible that this standard is too lax, since we might find plenty of giving opportunities in the future that are much stronger than direct cash transfers. However, at this early stage, it isn&rsquo;t obvious how we will find several billion dollars&rsquo; worth of such opportunities, and so &ndash; as long as total giving remains within the ... budget &ndash; we prefer to err on the side of recommending grants when we&rsquo;ve completed an investigation and when they look substantially better than direct cash transfers.<br />
<br />
It is, of course, often extremely unclear how to compare the good accomplished by a given grant to the good accomplished by direct cash transfers. Sometimes we will be able to do a rough quantitative estimate to determine whether a given grant looks much better, much worse or within the margin of error. (In the case of our top charities, <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/18/our-updated-top-charities-for-giving-season-2015/"">we think that donations to AMF, SCI and Deworm the World look substantially better.</a>) Other times we may have little to go on for making the comparison other than intuition. Still, thinking about the comparison can be informative. For example, when considering grants that will primarily benefit people in the U.S. (such as supporting work on criminal justice reform), benchmarking to direct cash transfers can be a fairly high standard. Based on the idea that the value of additional money is roughly proportional to the logarithm of income, {footnote_1} and the fact that mean American income is around 100x annual consumption for GiveDirectly recipients, we assume that a given dollar is worth ~100x as much to a GiveDirectly recipient as to the average American. Thus, in considering grants that primarily benefit Americans, we look for a better than &ldquo;100x return&rdquo; in financial terms (e.g. increased income). Of course, there are always huge amounts of uncertainty in these comparisons, and we try not to take them too literally.</blockquote>

<p>To walk through the logic of how this generates a &ldquo;100x&rdquo; bar a bit more clearly:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We want to be able to compare philanthropic opportunities that will save the U.S. or state governments money, or increase incomes for average Americans, against opportunities to directly help the global poor (or deliver other benefits) in a somewhat consistent fashion. For instance, we could imagine a hypothetical domestic advocacy opportunity that might be able to save the government $100 million, or increase productivity by $100 million, for a cost of $1 million; we would call that opportunity roughly &ldquo;100x&rdquo; because the benefit in terms of income to the average American is $100 for every $1 we spend.{footnote_2} If we just directly gave a random person in the U.S. $1,000, we&rsquo;d expect to get &ldquo;1x&rdquo; because the benefit to them is equal to the cost to us (ignoring transaction costs). That is, we take our core unit of measurement for this exercise as &ldquo;dollars to the average American.&rdquo; Then we face the question: how should we compare transfers to the global poor (or other programs) to transfers to the average American?</li>
	<li>GiveWell reports that the income of GiveDirectly recipients averages $0.79 per day{footnote_3} &mdash; so approximately $290 per person per year, compared to more than $34,000 per capita per year in the U.S.{footnote_4} This means $34,000 could double one individual&rsquo;s income for a year in the U.S., or (after ~10% overhead is taken out) double the income of about 106 GiveDirectly recipients for a year.{footnote_5}</li>
	<li>In this context we assume a logarithmic utility function for income, which is a fairly common simplification and assumes that doubling a person&rsquo;s income contributes the same amount to their well-being regardless of how much income they started with. We think this is a plausible starting point based on evidence from life satisfaction surveys.{footnote_6} However, it is worth noting that there are credible arguments that a logarithmic utility function places either too much or too little weight on income at the high end.{footnote_7}<fn> </fn></li>
	<li>A logarithmic utility function implies that $1 for someone with 100x less income/consumption is worth 100x as much. This implies direct cash transfers to the extreme global poor go about 100x as far as the same money spent in the U.S., on average, and means any potential grant should create an expected value at least 100x the cost of the grant if it is to be considered a better use of money than such direct cash transfers.</li>
	<li>With other causes, in addition to looking at monetary savings or gains, we also use &ldquo;value of a statistical life&rdquo; techniques to try to account for health and quality-of-life benefits. That yields more cost-effectiveness estimates, all generally framed in the language of &ldquo;This seems roughly as good as saving an average American $N for each $1 we spend&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;Nx.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, calculations like this remain deeply uncertain and vulnerable to large mistakes, so we try to not put too much weight on them in any one case. But the general reality that they reflect&nbsp;&mdash; of vast global inequalities, and the relative ease of moving money from people who have a lot of it to people who have little&nbsp;&ndash; seems <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/11/the-moral-case-for-giving-doesnt-rely-on-questionable-quantitative-estimates/"">quite robust</a>.</p>

<p>Although we stopped formally using this 100x benchmark across all of our giving <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy#No_more_unified_benchmark"">a couple of years ago</a> because of considerations relating to animals and future generations, we have continued to find it a useful benchmark against which &ldquo;<a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy"">near-termist, human-centric</a>&rdquo; grants &ndash; those that aim to improve the lives of humans on a relatively short time horizon, including a mix of direct aid, policy work, and scientific research&nbsp;&ndash; can be measured.</p>

<h2><a id=""bestprograms"" name=""bestprograms""></a>The best programs are even harder to beat</h2>

<p>In 2015, when we <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/25/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later/#Benchmark"">first wrote about adopting the cash transfer benchmark</a>, it looked like GiveWell could plausibly &ldquo;run out&rdquo; of their more-cost-effective-than-cash giving opportunities. <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/18/our-updated-top-charities-for-giving-season-2015/"">At the time</a>, they had three non-cash-transfer top charities they estimated to be in the 5-10x cash range (i.e., 5 to 10 times more cost-effective than cash transfers),{footnote_8} with ~$145 million of estimated short-term room for more funding. That, plus uncertainty about the amount of weight to put on these figures, led us to adopt the cash transfer benchmark. (In the remainder of this post, I occasionally shorten &ldquo;cash transfer&rdquo; to just &ldquo;cash.&rdquo;) But by <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2018/11/26/our-updated-top-charities-for-giving-season-2018/"">the end of 2018</a>, GiveWell had expanded to seven non-cash-transfer top charities estimated to be in the ~5-15x cash range, with $290 million of estimated short-term room for more funding, and with the top recommended unfilled gaps at ~8x cash transfers.{footnote_9} If we combine cash transfers at &ldquo;100x&rdquo; and large unfilled opportunities at ~5-15x cash transfers, the relevant &ldquo;bar to beat&rdquo; going forward may be more like 500-1,500x.{footnote_10} And <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2019/02/07/how-givewells-research-is-evolving/"">earlier this year</a> GiveWell suggested that they expected to find more cost-effective opportunities in the future, and they <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2019/02/07/how-givewells-research-is-evolving/"">are staffing up in order to do so</a>.</p>

<p>Another approach to this question is to ask, how much better than direct cash transfers should we expect the best underfunded interventions to be? I find scalable interventions worth ~5-15x cash <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/30/giving-cash-versus-giving-bednets/"">a bit surprising</a>, but not wildly so. It&rsquo;s not obvious where to look for a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability"">prior</a> on this point, and it seems to correlate strongly with general views about <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/"">broad market efficiency</a>: if you think broad &ldquo;markets for doing good&rdquo; are efficient, finding a scalable ~5-15x baseline intervention might be especially surprising; conversely if you think markets for doing good are riddled with inefficiencies, you might expect to find many even more cost-effective opportunities.</p>

<p>One place to potentially look for priors on this point might be compilations of the cost-effectiveness of various evidence-based interventions. I know of five compilations of the cost-effectiveness of different interventions within a given domain that contain easily available tabulations of the interventions reviewed:{footnote_11}</p>

</ul>

<p>For this purpose, I was just curious about the general distribution of the estimates, and didn&rsquo;t attempt to verify any of them, and was very rough in discarding estimates that were negative or didn&rsquo;t have numerical answers, which may bias my conclusions. In general, we regard the calculations included in these compilations as challenging and error-prone, and we would caution against over-reliance on them{footnote_12}.</p>

<p>I made a sheet summarizing the sources&rsquo; estimates <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Jy1SbeozJnIP6GY6VyQybXINC7orrBe4wBW-uVrIQ4/edit#gid=1413138877"">here</a>. All five distributions appear to be (very roughly) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution"">log-normal</a>, with standard deviations of ~0.7-1, implying that a one-standard-deviation increase in cost-effectiveness would equate to a 5-10x improvement. However, any errors in these calculations would typically inflate that figure, and we think they are structurally highly error-prone, so these standard deviations likely substantially overstate the true ones.{footnote_13}</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know what the mean of the true distribution of cost-effectiveness of global development opportunities might be, but assuming it&rsquo;s not more than a few times different from cash transfers (in either direction), and that measurement error doesn&rsquo;t make up more than half of the variance in the cost-effectiveness compilations reviewed above (a non-trivial assumption), then these figures imply <strong>we shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised to see top opportunities ~5-15x cash</strong>. A <a href=""http://www.normaltable.com/"">normal distribution</a> would imply that an opportunity two standard deviations above the mean is in the ~98th percentile. These figures would support more skepticism towards an opportunity from the same rough distribution (evidence-based global health interventions) that is claimed to be even more cost-effective (e.g., 100x or 1,000x cash rather than 10x).</p>

<p>Stepping back from the modeling, given the vast difference in treatment costs per person for different interventions (<a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf#CostperLLINdistributed"">~$5 for bednets</a>, <a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/Schistosomiasis-Control-Initiative#Our_analysis"">$0.33-~$1 for deworming</a>, <a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly"">~$250 for cash transfers</a>), it does seem plausible to have large (~10x) differences in cost-effectiveness.</p>

<p>Even if scalable global health interventions were much worse than we currently think, and, say, only ~3x as cost-effective as cash transfers, I expect <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2019/02/07/how-givewells-research-is-evolving/"">GiveWell&rsquo;s foray into more leveraged interventions</a> to yield substantial opportunities that are at least several times more cost-effective, pushing back towards ~10x cash transfers as a more relevant future benchmark for unfunded opportunities.</p>

<p>Overall, given that GiveWell&rsquo;s numbers imply something more like &ldquo;1,000x&rdquo; than &ldquo;100x&rdquo; for their current unfunded opportunities, that those numbers seem plausible (though by no means ironclad), and that they may find yet-more-cost-effective opportunities in the future, it looks like the relevant &ldquo;bar to beat&rdquo; going forward may be more like 1,000x than 100x.</p>

<h2><a id=""peopletoday"" name=""peopletoday""></a>Our other grantmaking aimed at helping people today</h2>

<p>While we think a lot of our &ldquo;<a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy"">near-termist, human-centric</a>&rdquo; grantmaking clears the 100x bar, we see less evidence that it will clear a ~1,000x bar.</p>

<p>Since we initially adopted the cash transfer benchmark in 2015, we&rsquo;ve made roughly 300 grants totalling almost $200 million in our <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy"">near-termist, human-centric</a> focus areas of <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/criminal-justice-reform"">criminal justice reform</a>, <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy"">immigration policy</a>, <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/land-use-reform"">land use reform</a>, <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/macroeconomic-policy"">macroeconomic stabilization policy</a>, and <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/scientific-research-archive"">scientific research</a>. To get a sense of our estimated returns for these grants, we looked at the largest grants and found 33 grants totalling $73M for which the grant investigator conducted an <em>ex ante</em> &ldquo;back-of-the-envelope-calculation&rdquo; (&ldquo;BOTEC&rdquo;) to roughly estimate the expected cost-effectiveness of the potential grant for Open Philanthropy decision-makers&rsquo; consideration.</p>

<p>All of these 33 grants were estimated by their investigator to have an expected cost-effectiveness of at least 100x. This makes sense given the existence of our &ldquo;100x bar.&rdquo; Of those 33, only eight grants, representing approximately $32 million, had BOTECs of 1,000x or greater. Our <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grants/target-malaria-general-support"">large grant to Target Malaria</a> accounts for more than half of that.</p>

<p>Although we don&rsquo;t typically make our internal BOTECs public, we compiled a set <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GsE2_TNWn0x6MWL1PTdkZT2vQNFW8VFBslC5qjk4sgo/edit?ts=5cc10604"">here</a> (redacted somewhat to protect some grantees&rsquo; confidentiality) to give a flavor of what they look like. As you can see, they are exceedingly rough, and take at face value many controversial and uncertain claims (e.g., the cost of a prison-year, the benefit of a new housing unit in a supply-constrained area, the impact of monetary policy on wages, the likely impacts of various other policy changes, stated probabilities of our grantees&rsquo; work causing a policy change). We would guess that these uncertainties would generally lead our BOTECs to be over-optimistic (rather than merely adding unbiased noise) for a variety of reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Program officers do the calculations themselves, and generally only do the calculations for grants they&rsquo;re already inclined to recommend. Even if there&rsquo;s zero cynicism or intentional manipulation to get &ldquo;above the bar,&rdquo; grantmakers (including me) seem likely to be more charitable to their grants than others would be.</li>
	<li>Many of these estimates don&rsquo;t adjust for relatively straightforward considerations that would systematically push towards lower estimated cost-effectiveness, like declining marginal returns to funding at the grantee level, time discounting, or potential non-replicability of the research our policy goals are based on. The comparison with the level of care in <a href=""https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models"">the GiveWell cost-effectiveness models</a> on these features is pretty stark.</li>
	<li>Holden made some more general arguments along these lines <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/"">in 2011</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We think it&rsquo;s notable that <strong>despite likely being systematically over-optimistic in this way, it&rsquo;s still rare for us to find grant opportunities in U.S. policy and scientific research that appear to score better than GiveWell&rsquo;s top charities</strong>. Of course, compared to GiveWell, we make many more grants, to more diverse activities, and with an <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/projects-people-and-processes"">explicit policy</a> of trying to rely more on program officer judgment than these BOTECs. So the idea that our models look less robust than GiveWell&rsquo;s is not a surprise &mdash; we&rsquo;ve always expected that to be the case &mdash; but combining that with GiveWell&rsquo;s rising bar is a more substantive update.</p>

<h2><a id=""counterconsiderations"" name=""counterconsiderations""></a>Some counter-considerations in favor of our work</h2>

<p>As we&rsquo;re grappling with the considerations above, we don&rsquo;t want to give short shrift to the arguments in favor of our work. We see two broad categories of arguments in this vein: (a) this work may be substantively better than the BOTECs imply; and (b) it&rsquo;s a worthwhile experiment.</p>

<p><em>This work may be better than the BOTECs imply</em></p>

<p>There are a couple big reasons why Open Phil&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy"">near-termist, human-centric</a> work could turn out to be better than implied by the figures above:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Values/moral weights</strong>. A logarithmic utility function and view that &ldquo;all lives have equal value&rdquo; push strongly towards work focused on the global poor. But many people endorse much flatter utility functions in money and the use of context-specific &ldquo;value of a statistical life&rdquo; figures, both of which would make work in the U.S. generally look much more attractive. And of course many people think we have stronger normative obligations to attend to our neighbors and fellow citizens, which would also make our non-GiveWell near-termist work look more valuable (though we have historically <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/04/deep-value-judgments-and-worldview-characteristics/"">been skeptical of such normative views</a>). (You could make similar arguments on instrumental rather normative grounds too, e.g., by arguing that <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/"">flow-through effects</a> from work in the U.S. would be larger.) Arguably we should put some weight on ideas like these in our <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/worldview-diversification#The_case_for_worldview_diversification"">worldview diversification process</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Hits</strong>. We are explicitly pursuing a <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/hits-based-giving"">hits-based approach to philanthropy</a> with much of this work, and accordingly might expect just one or two &ldquo;hits&rdquo; from our portfolio to carry the whole. In particular, if one or two of our large science grants ended up 10x more cost-effective than GiveWell&rsquo;s top charities, our portfolio to date would cumulatively come out ahead. In fact, the dollar-weighted average of the 33 BOTECs we collected above is (modestly) above the 1,000x bar, reflecting our <em>ex ante</em> assessment of that possibility. But the concerns about the informational value of those BOTECs remain, and most of our grants seems noticeably less likely to deliver such &ldquo;hits.&rdquo;</li>
	<li><strong>Mistaken analysis</strong>. As we&rsquo;ve noted, we consider our BOTECs to be extremely rough. We think it&rsquo;s more likely than not that better-quality BOTECs would make the work discussed above look still weaker, relative to GiveWell top charities - but we are far from certain of this, and it could go either way, especially if our policy reform efforts could contribute meaningfully to &ldquo;tipping points&rdquo; that lead to accelerating policy changes in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s a worthwhile experiment</em></p>

<p>Our <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy"">near-termist, human-centric</a> giving since adopting the cash benchmark can be broken into roughly three groups: ~$100M for U.S. policy, ~$100M for scientific research, and ~$300M based on GiveWell recommendations in global health and development. We think given the amount of giving we anticipate doing in the future, an experimental effort of that scale is worth running. As <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/worldview-diversification#Capacity_building_and_option_value"">we&rsquo;ve discussed before</a>, we see many benefits from giving in multiple different kinds of causes that are not fully captured by the impact of the grants themselves, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Learning</strong>. If our only giving were in long-termist and animal-oriented causes and to the GiveWell top charities, we think we&rsquo;d learn a lot less about effective giving writ large and the full suite of tools available to a philanthropist aiming to effect change. We think that would make us less effective overall (though we give limited weight to this consideration).</li>
	<li><strong>Developing a concrete track record</strong>. We see a lot of value for ourselves and others in working in some areas with relatively short feedback loops, where it&rsquo;s easier to observe whether our giving is achieving its intended impact. We would like it to be possible for us and others to recognize whether we are achieving any of our desired impacts, and that looks far more likely in our <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy"">near-termist human-centric</a> causes than in the bulk of the other causes we work on.</li>
	<li><strong>Option value</strong>. Developing staff capacity to work in many (different kinds of) causes provides the ability to adjust if our desired worldview allocation changes over time (which seems quite possible).</li>
	<li><strong>Helping other donors</strong>. Giving in a diverse set of causes increases our long-run odds of having large effects on the general dialogue around philanthropy, since we could provide tangibly useful information to a larger set of donors.</li>
</ul>

<p>We see a number of other practical benefits to working in a broad variety of causes, including presenting an accurate public-facing picture of our values and making our organization a more appealing place to work.</p>

<p>Finally, it is worth noting that while we think GiveWell&rsquo;s cost-effectiveness estimates are (far) more reliable than the very rough BOTECs we have done, we do not think their estimates (or any cost-effectiveness estimates we&rsquo;ve ever seen) can be taken literally, or even used with much confidence.</p>

<h2><a id=""shouldbe"" name=""shouldbe""></a>It should be possible to outperform the GiveWell top charities</h2>

<p>Although this post describes some doubts about how some of our giving to date may compare to the GiveWell top charities, we continue to think it should be possible to achieve more cost-effective results than the current GiveWell top charities via advocacy or scientific research funding rather than direct services. To the extent that there is a single overarching update here &mdash; which we are uncertain about &mdash; we think it is likely to be against the possibility of achieving sufficient leverage via advocacy or scientific research aimed at benefiting people in the U.S. or other wealthy countries <em>alone</em>. We have only explored a small portion of the space of possible causes in this broad area, and continue to expect that advocacy or scientific research, perhaps more squarely aimed at the global poor, could have outsized impacts. Indeed, GiveWell seems to agree this is possible, with their <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2019/02/07/how-givewells-research-is-evolving/"">expansion into considering advocacy opportunities</a> within global health and development.</p>

<p>As we look more closely at our returns to date and going forward, we&rsquo;re also interested in exploring other causes that may have especially high returns. One hypothesis we&rsquo;re interested in exploring is the idea of combining multiple sources of leverage for philanthropic impact (e.g., advocacy, scientific research, helping the global poor) to get more humanitarian impact per dollar (for instance via <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus-area/scientific-research/science-policy-and-infrastructure"">advocacy around scientific research funding or policies</a>, or <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/scientific-research/miscellaneous/target-malaria-general-support"">scientific research around global health interventions</a>, or <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-health-and-development/miscellaneous/center-global-development-general-support-2016"">policy around global health and development</a>). Additionally, on the advocacy side, we&rsquo;re interested in exploring opportunities outside the U.S.; we initially focused on U.S. policy for epistemic rather than moral reasons, and expect most of the most promising opportunities to be elsewhere.</p>

<p>If this sounds interesting, you should consider applying: we&rsquo;re <a href=""https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/openphilanthropyorg/view/P_AAAAAAFAACuGJXzLj5l5Sp?trackingTag=openPhilanthropyWebsite"">hiring for researchers</a> to help.</p>

<h2><a id=""conclusion"" name=""conclusion""></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We are still in the process of thinking through the implications of these claims, and we are not planning any rapid changes to our grantmaking at this time. We currently plan to continue making grants in our current focus areas at approximately the same level as we have for the last few years while we try to come to more confident conclusions about the balance of considerations above. As Holden outlined in a <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/blog/our-progress-in-2018-and-plans-for-2019/#self-evaluation"">recent blog post</a>, a major priority for the next couple years is building out our impact evaluation function. We expect that will help us develop a more confident read on our impact in our most mature portfolio areas, and accordingly will place us in a better position to approach big programmatic decisions. We will hopefully improve the overall quality of our BOTECs in other ways as well.</p>

<p>If, after building out this impact evaluation function and applying it to our work to date, we decided to substantially reduce or wind down our giving in any of our current focus areas, we&rsquo;d do so gradually and responsibly, with ample warning and at least a year or more of additional funding (as much as we feel is necessary for a responsible transition) to our key partner organizations. We have no current plans to do this, and we know funders communicating openly about this kind of uncertainty is unusual and can be unnerving, but our hope is that sharing our latest thinking will be <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-how-were-thinking-about-openness-and-information-sharing#Our_approach_going_forward"">useful for others</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we&rsquo;re planning to write more at a later date about the cost-effectiveness of our &ldquo;<a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy"">long-termist</a>&rdquo; and animal-inclusive grantmaking and the implications for our future resource allocation.</p>
","<p>See e.g. <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/research/subjective-well%E2%80%90being-and-income-is-there-any-evidence-of-satiation/"">Subjective Well‐Being and Income: Is There Any Evidence of Satiation?</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702021919/https://www.brookings.edu/research/subjective-well%E2%80%90being-and-income-is-there-any-evidence-of-satiation/"">archive</a>)</p>

<blockquote>For instance Deaton (2008) and Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) find that the well-being&ndash;income relationship is roughly a linear-log relationship, such that, while each additional dollar of income yields a greater increment to measured happiness for the poor than for the rich, there is no satiation point.</blockquote>
|<p>We&rsquo;re eliding a huge amount of complexity here in terms of modeling the domestic welfare impacts of various policy changes, which we recognize. In practice, our calculations are often very crude, though we try to be roughly consistent in considering distributional issues and weighing whether incomes are increasing due to productivity changes, prevented waste, or other causes.</p>
|<p>See <a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly#footnote33_26yj8bd"">footnote 33</a> in GiveWell&rsquo;s writeup on GiveDirectly.</p>
|<p>2017 average U.S., per capita income was $34,489, <a href=""https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html"">per the U.S. Census</a>. (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022008/https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html"">archive</a>)</p>
|<p>$34,000 / ($288.35 / 0.9) = ~106. Using median U.S. income rather than mean would reduce this ~20% but seems less apt as a comparison since we&rsquo;re partially modeling foregone spending and taxes are moderately progressive.</p>

(<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022049/https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/2008a_bpea_stevenson.pdf"">archive</a>)</p>
|<p>Too much: there is <a href=""https://flightfromperfection.com/files/post_attachments/jebb_et_al_2018.pdf"">some evidence of satiation</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022114/https://flightfromperfection.com/files/post_attachments/jebb_et_al_2018.pdf"">archive</a>) in terms of self-reported wellbeing even in log terms as incomes get very high by global standards. Additionally, if you think very high incomes carry net negative externalities (e.g., through carbon emissions or excess political influence), you may even think additional income at the high end should be treated as negative. Finally, placing high moral weight on marginal consumption for high-income people seems to imply that their lives &ldquo;have a lot more value in them&rdquo; or &ldquo;are worth a lot more,&rdquo; which seems problematic.</p>

<p><br />
Too little: people continue to exercise substantial effort to increase their own income, even at high levels, and there seem to be obvious benefits beyond subjective wellbeing that accrue to them from doing so (such as increased lifespan or educational access). Additionally, if you&rsquo;re discounting income or consumption logarithmically or more, even very small positive spillovers from high income people to others (e.g., through employment, charity, or bequests) could swamp the first order effects in a utility calculation.</p>
|<p>This 5-10x cash range translated to roughly ~$2,000-4,000 per &ldquo;life saved equivalent&rdquo; in the 2015 cost-effectiveness calculation - <a href=""https://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/Interventions/GiveWell_cost-effectiveness_analysis_2015.xlsx"">XLSX</a>.</p>
|<p>Based on <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15pzFH5e4k4qQwOX5ffqQcJNPK4RnVJ-b5EFd9ZUtlJs/edit#gid=1034883018"">the median results from GiveWell&rsquo;s final 2018 cost-effectiveness calculation</a>, 8x cash implies a &ldquo;cost-per outcome as good as saving an under-5 life&rdquo; of ~$1,500. This is not directly comparable to the figures from 2015 because GiveWell made some changes in the values and framework used in their cost-effectiveness calculation, which affect both the outcome measures and the comparisons between them.</p>
|<p>Another way to get similarly high overall ROI figures is from comparing GiveWell&rsquo;s top charity &ldquo;cost per life saved equivalent&rdquo; figures to rich world &ldquo;value of a statistical life&rdquo; figures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>GiveWell estimates that <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1McptF0GVGv-QBlhWx_IoNVstWvt1z-RwVSu16ciypgs/edit?pli=1#gid=1364064522"">bednets</a> and <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1McptF0GVGv-QBlhWx_IoNVstWvt1z-RwVSu16ciypgs/edit?pli=1#gid=385523701"">seasonal malaria chemoprevention</a> and <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1McptF0GVGv-QBlhWx_IoNVstWvt1z-RwVSu16ciypgs/edit?pli=1#gid=675486926"">vitamin A supplementation</a> all can save lives for (low) single digit thousands of dollars and have substantial funding gaps remaining. We tend to place much more weight on GiveWell&rsquo;s figures than other sources, but estimates in this range are not unusual; <a href=""https://www.gavi.org/about/mission/facts-and-figures/"">Gavi</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022141/https://www.gavi.org/about/mission/facts-and-figures/"">archive</a>) and <a href=""https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/news/2018-09-12-global-fund-partnership-has-saved-27-million-lives/"">the Global Fund</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022233/https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/news/2018-09-12-global-fund-partnership-has-saved-27-million-lives/"">archive</a>) make similar claims (not <a href=""http://sites.bu.edu/neudc/files/2014/10/paper_400.pdf"">without</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022320/http://sites.bu.edu/neudc/files/2014/10/paper_400.pdf"">archive</a>) <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)33055-1/fulltext"">controversy</a>) (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022344/https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)33055-1/fulltext"">archive</a>).</li>
	<li>Standard &ldquo;value of a statistical life&rdquo; methods in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life#United_States"">the U.S. and other rich countries</a> imply values in the (high) single digit millions of dollars. For instance, the U.S. Department of Transportation uses a value of <a href=""https://cms.dot.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/2016%20Revised%20Value%20of%20a%20Statistical%20Life%20Guidance.pdf"">$9.6 million for a statistical life</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190702022456/https://cms.dot.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/2016%20Revised%20Value%20of%20a%20Statistical%20Life%20Guidance.pdf"">archive</a>), which is on the high side relative to other estimates.</li>
	<li>If we value the lives of children saved by GiveWell&rsquo;s global health charities the same way the DOT values lives lost in car crashes in the U.S., we would estimate ~5,000x returns ($9.6M benefit/~$2K cost per life saved equivalent).</li>
</ul>

<p>To be clear, this calculation violates the standard assumptions of value of a statistical life, one of which is that the value of a life depends on the income of a person who lives it, and is not endorsed by GiveWell (which has a more complicated moral weights system for comparing outcomes).</p>

We haven&rsquo;t looked closely at the other sources at all. Overall, we expect the project of trying to estimate the cost-effectiveness of many different interventions in uniform terms to be extremely difficult and error-prone, so we don&rsquo;t mean to endorse these specific estimates.</p>

"1118","History of Philanthropy Literature Review: Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs","<p><em>In this post, &ldquo;we&rdquo; refers to Good Ventures and the <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/who-we-are"">Open Philanthropy Project</a>, who work as partners.</em></p>

<p>We&#39;re now supporting <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/history-of-philanthropy"">History of Philanthropy</a> work via a <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grants/urban-institute-history-of-philanthropy-project"">grant to the Urban Institute</a>. One output of this project is a <a href=""https://www.urban.org/research/publication/pugwash-literature-review"">literature review</a> on the social impact of - and role of philanthropic funding in - the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugwash_Conferences_on_Science_and_World_Affairs"">Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs</a> (sometimes abbreviated as &quot;Pugwash&quot;), which &quot;brought together notable scientists from both sides of the iron curtain in order to discuss nuclear disarmament in an informal but serious atmosphere&quot; starting in 1957. This case is particularly interesting from the perspective of <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks"">global catastrophic risk reduction</a>, as Pugwash and its founder <a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1995/summary/"">won the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize</a> &quot;for their efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.&quot;</p>

<p>I thought this literature review made a fairly strong case for two propositions which, taken together, establish Pugwash as a seeming case of strong philanthropic impact via global catastrophic risk reduction:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The Pugwash conferences have a strong claim to having influenced national and international politics, in a direction of greater international cooperation and disarmament.</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Pugwash seems to be particularly associated, in the minds of the historians whose work was reviewed, with the 1963 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty"">Limited Test Ban Treaty</a>, which &quot;prohibited all test detonations of nuclear weapons except for those conducted underground,&quot; as well as the 1972 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Ballistic_Missile_Treaty"">anti-ballistic missile treaty</a>. On both counts, the report cites people who were highly involved in the negotiations, directly crediting Pugwash conferences.</li>
		<li>The report also states, &quot;The 1980s may have been the highpoint of Pugwash influence on Soviet policy, with Gorbachev telling Rotblat that Pugwash scientists were crucial in shaping his views against nuclear weapons, especially his foreign policy advisors Georgii Arbatov as well as [Yevgeny] Velikhov, who had attended Pugwash conferences. In general, according to Wittner, the antinuclear movement, including but not limited to Pugwash, heavily influenced Gorbachev&rsquo;s approach to the Cold War, and it seems likely that without the movement&rsquo;s influence, Gorbachev would not have been the transformative leader that he was.&quot;</li>
		<li>For more, see &quot;Pugwash: Main Claims of Impact&quot; at the end of the report.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>The Pugwash conferences seem to have persistently struggled to get funding, with philanthropic funders providing most of the support.</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>For the first conference, Pugwash&#39;s founder &quot;sent letters to &#39;a number of wealthy people in various countries asking for financial support&#39; but received only a depressing mix of &#39;small contributions&#39; and outright refusals. Fortunately for the scientists, both Aristotle Onassis and Cyrus Eaton eventually made offers to fund and host a conference in 1957, though each man wanted to dictate location. Eaton&rsquo;s offer (which the scientists soon accepted) required that the meeting be held in the resort town of Pugwash, Nova Scotia, where Eaton maintained a country lodge.&quot;</li>
		<li>However, Pugwash later sought to distance itself from Eaton, and the following quote gives a sense of the difficulties this led to: &quot;[Eaton&#39;s] friendly relations with Khrushchev, as well as his receipt of the Lenin Peace Prize in 1960, led anticommunists to attack the group. Pugwash scientists themselves grew irritated with Eaton&rsquo;s penchant for publicity, especially his desire to speak at the conferences, and they bemoaned being tainted by association with him, though they were loath to lose access to his funds .. When Pugwash did eventually reject Eaton as a sponsor, the group struggled to find other sources of money. Rotblat&rsquo;s histories reveal a substantial fixation on funding for Pugwash as a whole, primarily because it was so scarce. Among all the difficulties of conference planning, Rotblat writes in understatement, &#39;one of the greatest was the financial aspect&#39; ... Getting to the conferences also posed a substantial financial barrier; most scientists could not afford to travel abroad ... National groups paid for their own scientists&rsquo; travel. If a participant had no other sources of funding, the Continuing Committee attempted to supplement their travel fare but a shortage of travel money meant that fewer scientists could take part in Pugwash, especially those from remote countries ... Aside from conferences and national groups, the central Pugwash office in London also faced financial distress ... While a central office was necessary, one was not acquired for years after Pugwash&rsquo;s founding, &#39;owing to the uncertain financial prospects.&#39;&quot;</li>
		<li>This despite the fact that Pugwash&#39;s budget seems to have been relatively modest: &quot;Funding requests provide a sense of what U.S. Pugwash required financially in the 1960s. In 1963, its leaders estimated that they would need a budget of $50,000. Most years, however, the group would be forced to make do with roughly half that amount. By the end of 1964, for example, U.S. Pugwash ended up with $21,000 in income, and spent all but $500 of it ... 1965 was indeed precarious. By October the group had taken in $27,793.56, with $15,375.50 in expenses, leaving $12,418.06. Feld could count on $5,000 from the Christopher Reynolds Foundation, bringing the total up to $17,418.06, but with $26,450 in upcoming expenses, the group faced a $9,000 shortfall. The situation improved in 1966, as U.S. Pugwash had $45,000 on hand by the end of March. ... The financial situation improved in 1965 and 1966, when the Ford Foundation began to supply substantial assistance, including, at one point, about $20,000 per year ... Pugwash seems to have been almost constantly in danger of insolvency; money for staff, office space, conferences, and travel rarely came easy.&quot;</li>
		<li>For context, $50,000 in 1963 would be equivalent to something like $500,000 today.{footnote_1}<fn> </fn></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Since this was a literature review rather than a case study, I haven&#39;t reviewed a highly detailed case for Pugwash&#39;s impact, and am interested in learning more. Still, if one takes the above points at face value, I&#39;m struck by the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On one hand, this looks like an impressive potential case of impact for philanthropy, with major (and seeming risk-reducing) impacts on agreements between global superpowers facilitated by an organization that seemingly struggled to raise a relatively small amount of money, and got most of it from philanthropic sources.</li>
	<li>On the other hand, one could arguably take away the lesson that we shouldn&#39;t expect similar philanthropic opportunities in 2019 to what existed in the 1960s. My impression is that total philanthropic giving is far higher today, and it&#39;s fairly hard to imagine an influential series of conferences between top scientists struggling to raise $500,000 per year today.</li>
</ul>

","<p>I used <a href=""http://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1963?amount=50000"">this calculator </a>to get this approximate figure; it has $50,000 in 1963 as equivalent to $410,511.44 in 2019.</p>

"880","An Update to How the Open Philanthropy Project is Thinking About Grant Check-Ins","<p><em>In this post, &ldquo;we&rdquo; refers to Good Ventures and the<a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/who-we-are""> Open Philanthropy Project</a>, who work as partners.</em></p>

<p>The Open Philanthropy Project&rsquo;s mission is to give as effectively as we can and share our findings openly so that anyone can build on our work. When we first started making grants, we tended to assume that would mean conducting and publishing in-depth reviews of the performance of each grant. But as our first grants have wound down, we&rsquo;ve spent more time evaluating and reflecting on the work we&rsquo;ve done so far, and have developed a new framework to guide our approach to grant check-ins.</p>

<p>One lesson we&rsquo;ve learned is that our <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/swinging-for-the-fences"">hits-based approach to giving</a> substantially limits the benefits from a frame that focuses on grantee &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; per se. Many philanthropists require that their grantees provide detailed programmatic and financial reporting to demonstrate that funds were spent exactly as intended, and when we started making grants, we assumed this might be valuable for our giving as well. However, we have found limited value using this approach. Given the inherent riskiness of hits-based giving, we have found that closely tracking the performance of each individual grant isn&#39;t very informative, and accordingly, we don&rsquo;t plan on conducting or publishing the level of individual grant follow-up that we had initially anticipated.</p>

<p>Instead, we are generally performing relatively light check-ins, and internally report &ldquo;updates, lessons, and impact&rdquo; from each.</p>

<h2>The goal of a check-in: updates, lessons, impact</h2>

<p>We hope and expect to be more effective philanthropists 10 years from now than we are today, and we need to learn a lot to get there.</p>

<p>In addition to the investigation we conduct before we make any particular grant, we also try to learn from grants as they&rsquo;re in progress, and afterward, by checking in with grantees. Generally, check-ins consist of informal phone calls between a grantee and an Open Philanthropy staff member about every six months to discuss what&rsquo;s been working, what challenges have arisen, and what next steps the grantee plans to pursue for their project. What we learn from these conversations about a grant&rsquo;s execution and results plays a central part in our thinking about whether and to what extent to renew grants, and also informs other grantmaking in a given focus area and across the organization as a whole.</p>

<p>We focus our check-ins on gleaning updates, lessons, and impact:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Updates are new developments that either lower or raise our expectations for how much impact a grant will have</strong>, relative to where our expectations were at the time the grant was made. Because we usually are uncertain whether objectives will be achieved, if a grant meets its objectives, this is generally considered a &ldquo;positive update.&rdquo; The point of marking updates is to keep track of how everything is going and not necessarily to self-examine every time something goes more poorly than had been expected.</li>
	<li><strong>A lesson learned is an update an investigator makes to their model of how to give as well as possible.</strong> These lessons could be at the programmatic level or a broader lesson about philanthropy. Lessons will be much rarer than positive and negative updates. We have a lot of known uncertainty when we make grants, and if a grant with a 50% chance of working didn&rsquo;t work, that shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily make us think differently about the world or how to give. We expect that most grants will not yield lessons, even when there are notable positive or negative updates.</li>
	<li><strong>Impact means a grant has made the world better (or worse).</strong> Rather than tracking incremental progress (e.g. the release of a paper, hiring to fill a position, positive news coverage) that would count as an &ldquo;update,&rdquo; &ldquo;impact&rdquo; should be limited to major milestones that we are reasonably confident created good in the world, at least in expectation. When feasible, we try to quantify impact in terms of appropriate units: for example,&ldquo;dollars of value added to society&rdquo;; &ldquo;years of suffering reduced, adjusted for species and intensity of suffering&rdquo;; or &ldquo;percentage point change in the likelihood of a global catastrophic risk in the next 50 years.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grant check-ins in practice, and our evolving approach</h2>

<p>Early on, we tended to expect that we&rsquo;d be doing intensive, holistic evaluations of each grant (examples of statements along these lines are <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/center-global-development-labor-mobility-research#Follow-up_expectations"">here</a>, <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/macroeconomic-policy/center-budget-and-policy-priorities-full-employment-project#Plans_for_learning_and_follow-up"">here</a>, <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/scientific-research/miscellaneous/princeton-university-rescuing-biomedical-research#Plans_for_learning_and_follow-up"">here</a>, <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/land-use-reform/smart-growth-america-greater-greater-washington-education-project#Plans_for_learning_and_follow_up"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/land-use-reform/sightline-institute-housing-and-urban-development#Plans_for_learning_and_follow_up"">here</a>), and as the first grants from the earliest days of Open Phil wind down, a few have yielded particularly clear updates, lessons, and impact for us to learn from:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Update:</strong> We initially supported the Center for Popular Democracy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fed Up&rdquo; campaign in <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/center-for-popular-democracy-federal-reserve-campaign-august-2014"">August 2014</a> and <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/center-for-popular-democracy-fed-up-campaign-2015"">January 2015</a>. Over the following year, they developed partnerships in all 12 cities with Federal Reserve Banks, met with 10 of the 12 regional Fed presidents, and generated substantial press coverage for their 2015 Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. Based on their track record, we decided to <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/center-for-popular-democracy-fed-up-campaign-2016"">renew our support</a> for Fed Up for 2016, and <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/center-for-popular-democracy-fed-up-campaign"">subsequently renewed for 2017</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks in part to our <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/blue-ribbon-study-panel-on-biodefense-grant"">initial grant</a> in April 2015, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense released a report in October of that year with 33 practical recommendations to improve U.S. biodefense policy. We believe the report was generally well-received within government, influenced the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, was referenced multiple times in congressional hearings, and was cited by the CIA director in remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations. We decided to <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/blue-ribbon-study-panel-on-biodefense-general-support"">renew support</a> to enable the Study Panel to continue its efforts.</li>
	<li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Protect the People&rsquo;s program helped 58 Haitian farmers access seasonal work in the United States in 2016, shy of their goal of 150 farmers. <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/october-2017-update-protect-people-seasonal-migration-haiti#Lessons_learned_and_exit_grant"">We learned</a> that American farmers were less interested in hiring Haitians than we had anticipated, and there were more bureaucratic issues in the visa process than we think would likely need to be the case in order to create a sustainable long-term flow. Largely on this basis, we decided not to renew the grant.{footnote_1}</li>
	<li><strong>Impact:</strong> <a href=""/research-and-ideas/blog/why-are-the-us-corporate-cage-free-campaigns-succeeding"">Corporate campaigns have secured pledges</a> from over 200 US companies to eliminate battery cages from their egg supply chains, including from all of the top 25 US grocers and nearly all of the top 20 fast food chains. The <a href=""https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Egg%20Markets%20Overview.pdf"">U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated</a> that these pledges will affect around 225 million hens. These campaigns were primarily funded by $3 million in grants from the Open Philanthropy Project, split between four groups: <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/the-humane-league-corporate-cage-free-campaigns"">the Humane League</a>, <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/mercy-for-animals-corporate-cage-free-campaigns"">Mercy for Animals</a>, <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/the-humane-society-of-the-united-states-corporate-cage-free-campaigns"">the Humane Society of the United States&#39; Farm Animal Protection Campaign</a>, and <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/compassion-in-world-farming-usa-general-support"">Compassion in World Farming USA</a>. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that much or all of the success may have been inevitable once the early pledges (which preceded our funding) were achieved.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the relatively clear updates, lessons, and impact generated by these grants have been the exception rather than the rule. In most cases, particularly for grants that focus on field-building or policy and advocacy, we&rsquo;re funding a group that we don&rsquo;t expect to have clear, demonstrable effects on the metrics that we most care about over the course of an individual grant, and only rarely have such grantees clearly achieved success (or clearly failed). Some examples of these types of no-major-updates check-ins include our renewals of grants to the <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/center-on-budget-and-policy-priorities-full-employment-project-2016"">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>; <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/land-use-reform/greater-greater-washington-housing-and-land-use-reform"">Greater Greater Washington</a>; and <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/niskanen-center-research-on-immigration-policy-2018"">Niskanen Center</a>.</p>

<p>We think this is partly in the nature of <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/swinging-for-the-fences"">hits-based giving</a>. Many grants will fail to have an impact not because of any flaw in our thinking or in the grant&rsquo;s execution, but because it was a long shot that was always unlikely to succeed. Grantees in hits-based fields like advocacy or science often do roughly what they said they would do but still come up short of achieving the desired outcome in the world, and that&rsquo;s fine and exactly what we expect in a hits-based framework.</p>

<p>Given these considerations, we have developed a streamlined renewal process that encourages grant investigators to collect updates, lessons, and impact, and avoids repeating the whole grant investigation process. For a grant renewal, investigators skip requesting approval to show <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/our-grantmaking-so-far-approach-and-process#decisionprocess"">&ldquo;strong interest&rdquo; in a prospective grant</a> and instead attempt to answer questions they highlighted in their original investigation, score their own predictions from the original grant, and determine if further work on a project is warranted or if a strategy should be updated or revised to reflect lessons learned. In terms of public sharing, we prioritize doing so when we think it is especially informative (e.g. in the case of unusually clear or large lessons and impact), which we hope will be useful to emerging philanthropists.</p>
","<p>However, after the grant concluded, two of the farms that had participated in the program secured 59 visas for Haitian farmers, which indicates that the increase in Haitian access to seasonal farm work in the U.S. may have outlived our support for the program and could suggest either that we may have been premature in winding down funding for a program that just needed more time to find its stride or that the key work of getting the initial farms to engage with the program was already complete and further funding was not necessary to ensure their continued participation.</p>

"823","Update on Investigating Neglected Goals in Biological Research","<p><em>In this post, &ldquo;we&rdquo; refers to Good Ventures and the <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/who-we-are"">Open Philanthropy Project</a>, who work as partners.</em></p>

<p>We divide our scientific research funding into two categories: neglected goals and basic research. We believe that some research areas are underfunded because achieving the relevant research objectives is underrated by the &quot;<a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/"">broad market</a>&quot; (according to our values). We call such research objectives &quot;<a href=""/research-and-ideas/blog/investigating-neglected-goals-in-scientific-research"">neglected goals</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2014, we set a <a href=""/research-and-ideas/blog/progress-in-2013-and-plans-for-2014"">goal</a> to be in a position to identify focus areas in science by the end of 2016. This post explains our initial plan for this work, our original hopes and expectations, what we have done so far, and our plans for work in this area going forward. In brief:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Our initial plan was to identify focus areas using a series of shallow and medium-depth <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports"">investigations</a>, analogous to the <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-selection#Exploring_potential_focus_areas"">process</a> we used to identify focus areas in U.S. policy and global catastrophic risks.</li>
	<li>We found that our investigations took longer than expected and we felt that they gave us an inadequate basis to declare focus areas and hire specialist program staff to lead our work in those areas. Moreover, we could not envision investigations with acceptable time costs that would form an adequate basis for making such decisions.</li>
	<li>However, our investigations did, in multiple cases, result in our science advisors&#39; identifying &quot;standout&quot; giving opportunities: giving opportunities that seemed unusually promising by the standards of the field they were investigating, and strong compared to giving opportunities we&#39;ve seen generally.</li>
	<li>We decided to pivot to a model in which generalist scientific advisors are given a broad mandate to opportunistically identify standout giving opportunities within about a dozen areas. Rather than investigating each area in depth and choosing a few as focus areas, they investigate one at a time, looking primarily for standout opportunities, and choose which area to investigate based on their subjective estimate of the odds of finding standout opportunities. We&#39;re very excited by the giving opportunities that the science team is finding under this model, and it&#39;s unclear whether it would have been better to use our previous model and hire staff specializing in just a couple of program areas.</li>
	<li>A spreadsheet summarizing our list of priorities and cause-specific progress so far (listed in alphabetical order) is <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14UIDxihRLZyWySWYqf3NECGjEOeH_s5tLnXmHtJz1z0/edit#gid=0"">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are likely to give a separate, shorter update on basic research in the future.{footnote_1}</p>

<h2>Our initial plan</h2>

<p>Our initial plan for identifying neglected research goals to fund was modeled on the process that we used to identify focus areas in <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy"">U.S. policy</a> and <a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks"">global catastrophic risks</a>. The general strategy was to quickly get basic information about the comparative importance, tractability, and neglectedness of the potential focus areas and then select those that seemed outstanding relative to those criteria. The key steps of that process were as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Collect dozens of potential focus areas from conversations with experts, conversations with others in our network, and our background knowledge</li>
	<li>Select about a dozen potential focus areas for &quot;<a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports"">shallow investigations</a>&quot;</li>
	<li>Select several for &quot;<a href=""https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports"">medium-depth investigations</a>&quot;</li>
	<li>Potentially identify specialists to lead our work in the most outstanding areas identified (relative to the criteria)</li>
</ul>
<!--break-->

<h2>Our hopes and expectations</h2>

<p>When applying this process to global catastrophic risks and U.S. policy, we found that relatively brief investigations of potential focus areas were able to give us a sense of the comparative importance, tractability, and neglectedness of the areas we investigated. We hoped that something similar would be true when investigating potential science focus areas, and some areas we considered would emerge as outstanding focus areas to support in comparison with the others.</p>

<p>We also hoped, but did not expect with confidence, that we would find some areas of science to fund that would have outstanding returns in comparison with the best-in-class giving opportunities that Open Philanthropy has discovered so far. <!--break--></p>

<h2>Our process applied to biology</h2>

<p>We began to apply this strategy to neglected research goals in mid 2015. We first brainstormed about 40 biology-related areas to investigate. (We started with biology for reasons discussed in <a href=""https://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/26/scientific-research-funding/"">this post</a>.) We selected about 15 for special consideration based on simple estimation of problem size (drawing from disease burden estimates or prior investigations or other causes); available information on funding to the field (e.g. from <a href=""http://grantome.com"">grantome.com</a> or the <a href=""https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx"">NIH website</a>); and our intuitions about neglectedness.</p>

<p>We started &quot;shallow&quot; investigations while hiring generalist scientific advisors. Job candidates worked with us on these investigations as trial assignments. Our current scientific advisors joined the organization full time in mid 2016. <!--break--></p>

<h2>Results vs. hopes and expectations</h2>

<p>After some iteration, we settled on a process in which our scientific advisors spend a month surveying a field and trying to identify outstanding grant opportunities, prepare an internal report, and then seek to make grants that are either (i) potentially very high upside (even if not shovel-ready) or (ii) good, shovel-ready, and requiring limited investigation. Right now, the best illustration of this process is our report on the <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/mechanisms-aging"">mechanisms of aging</a>.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve now investigated five goals using this approach, including mechanisms of aging, obesity, novel platforms for vaccine development (for biosecurity), broad-spectrum antivirals (for biosecurity), and developing world agriculture. (We also investigated some other areas with other methods, including malaria, tuberculosis, STDs, gene drives, <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/animal-product-alternatives"">animal product alternatives</a>, and Alzheimer&#39;s.) Given the time cost involved and the fact that we already seek and receive input from subject matter experts privately, we currently don&#39;t have plans to produce public write-ups related to most of these investigations.{footnote_2}<fn> </fn></p>

<p>We found the &quot;shallow&quot; investigations useful for getting an overview of the technical challenges in a field and highlighting dynamic areas of research that could be considered for additional grantmaking. However, we found these investigations less useful for getting a sense of what sorts of scientific advances might be realistic on what timelines, how much funding fields could productively absorb, or what fraction of the most important work would happen anyway without our support. When we began this process, we guessed that a handful of potential focus areas were most promising. While our opinions about how best to pursue grantmaking in these areas changed (in some cases, substantially so), our list didn&#39;t change very much. We didn&#39;t feel this would be an adequate basis for declaring specific program areas or hiring people to lead them, and we could not envision investigations with acceptable time costs that would form an adequate basis for making such decisions. So we began to consider alternatives to our previous model for identifying focus areas and finding staff to lead our work in those focus areas.</p>

<p>Though our investigations left many important questions unanswered, they did serve a number of other valuable purposes. Most importantly, they gave our scientific advisors enough familiarity with the area investigated that they could seek out and evaluate opportunities in the area, and some of these opportunities led to grants or investments that seem outstanding to us. Examples include: <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/target-malaria-general-support"">Target Malaria</a> (global health), <a href=""/our-portfolio/other-investments"">Impossible Foods</a> (animal welfare), and some ideas for broad-spectrum antivirals (biosecurity, currently under investigation). These opportunities were (often large) grants/investments with a clear potential path to solving or substantially alleviating a major problem related to one of our existing program areas.</p>

<p>These opportunities seem ballpark-competitive with, and in some cases superior to, other best-in-class giving opportunities that we are aware of. In addition, they seem relatively exceptional to us in the sense that we don&#39;t think we can identify many comparable opportunities in those areas - global health, biosecurity, and animal welfare - in the near future. For example, GiveWell&#39;s estimated cost per life saved for AMF is <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1gVbwg7Og9CIekG-9r2J0lyolNILQ_yDWbEmR7OimCKs/edit?usp=sharing"">roughly $7500</a>, and I&#39;d estimate that the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E8qu474nUUvPjK21oBqGkdQ9FuXanigOgSGfumhL3_c/edit#gid=1061406209"">expected cost per life saved</a> for our grant to <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/target-malaria-general-support"">Target Malaria</a> is substantially lower (perhaps 5-20x lower, though less robust).{footnote_3}<fn> </fn> However, based on a cursory investigation of other opportunities to fund science relevant to tuberculosis and malaria, most other opportunities in related areas seem substantially less promising than Target Malaria and therefore unlikely to offer expected returns much better than AMF.</p>

<p>We also explored some funding opportunities through two other methods: a RFP in partnership with NIH for high-risk, high-reward research (write-up forthcoming) and a series of brainstorming conversations with scientists whose work we find especially interesting.{footnote_4} These approaches led to some exciting grant opportunities, though at a lower rate per unit staff time than the approaches discussed above. <!--break--></p>

<h2>Our new plan</h2>

<p>In light of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>challenges to getting the information that would be needed to select science focus areas and hire specialist program staff to run them,</li>
	<li>the fact that our generalist scientific advisors were able to find outstanding giving opportunities without hiring program staff for specific focus areas, and</li>
	<li>the fact that these giving opportunities seemed superior to the opportunities we could find using other methods,</li>
</ul>

<p>we abandoned our previous cause selection model (in this instance) in favor of a more opportunistic approach.</p>

<p>We now plan for our generalist scientific advisors to do exploratory grantmaking relevant to potential neglected goals we have identified, in accordance with the following principles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Prioritize exploratory grantmaking aiming for standout giving opportunities addressing the neglected goals we consider reasonably high-priority.</li>
	<li>Other things being equal, give priority to investigations in areas related to existing program areas (especially biosecurity and farm animal welfare) and Alzheimer&#39;s disease (which is a high priority for Good Ventures, and which Open Philanthropy has agreed to help with research on for this reason; Open Philanthropy expects grants in this category to be classified as Good Ventures grants that [it] assisted with, rather than as Open Philanthropy Project grants that went through its full process).</li>
</ul>

<p>We see this as a relatively natural division of cognitive labor: generalist staff with a deep understanding of Open Philanthropy&#39;s values and objectives identify goals that would be valuable to accomplish and are likely to be neglected, and generalist scientific advisors are given a broad mandate to opportunistically identify projects and program strategies that would be likely to accomplish the objectives. Currently, we&#39;re very excited by the giving opportunities that the science team is finding under this model, and it&#39;s unclear whether it would have been better to use our standard model and hire specialist staff in just a couple of program areas. If we repeatedly find outstanding work to fund in some of these areas, we&#39;ll consider making them permanent focus areas and hiring dedicated program staff in those areas.</p>

<p>A spreadsheet summarizing our list of priorities and cause-specific progress so far (listed in alphabetical order) is <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14UIDxihRLZyWySWYqf3NECGjEOeH_s5tLnXmHtJz1z0/edit#gid=0"">here</a>.</p>
","<p>Note that we have funded some basic research that is not related to neglected goals (<a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-synthetic-neurobiology-group"">example</a>), and we plan to fund more such basic science in the future.</p>
|<p>Our scientific advisors prefer not to publish the rough internal reports produced without doing a significant amount of work to clarify and refine them, and Open Philanthropy decided it would not be an optimal use of time for them to do so at this time.</p>
|<p>Given our rough cost-effectiveness calculation, this range would correspond to an assumption that the grant accelerates Target Malaria&#39;s timeline by 2-10 expected months in worlds where they succeed at their long-term objective.</p>
|<p>No public notes from the latter set of conversations are available, though we may summarize our process and conclusions in the future.</p>

<p>About when <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/chloe-cockburn"">Chloe Cockburn</a> <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/process-hiring-our-first-cause-specific-program-officer"">joined</a> Open Philanthropy to spearhead our grantmaking for criminal justice reform, I was tasked with reviewing the research on whether reducing the number of people in American jails and prisons might actually increase crime. In effect, we at Open Philanthropy asked ourselves: what if we&#39;re wrong? What if our grantees win reforms that cut the number of people behind bars, and that pushes the crime rate up? How likely is that? And how likely is it that any increase would be large enough to overshadow the benefits of decarceration, which include taxpayer savings and expanded human freedom?</p>

<p>It may seem strange to launch a grantmaking program even as we question its empirical basis. But Open Philanthropy had already invested significant time in <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/criminal-justice-reform"">studying criminal justice reform as a cause</a>. And practical decisions must always be made in the face of incomplete information, forcing people and organizations to exercise what Herbert Simon called &quot;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality#Origins"">bounded rationality</a>.&quot; It can be boundedly rational to act on the information gathered so far, even as we gather more.</p>

<p>The final report reaches two major conclusions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I estimate, that at typical policy margins in the United States today, decarceration has zero net impact on crime. That estimate is uncertain, but at least as much evidence suggests that decarceration <em>reduces</em> crime as increases it. The crux of the matter is that tougher sentences hardly deter crime, and that while imprisoning people temporarily stops them from committing crime outside prison walls, it also tends to increase their criminality <em>after </em>release. As a result, &quot;tough-on-crime&quot; initiatives can reduce crime in the short run but cause offsetting harm in the long run.</li>
	<li>Empirical social science research---or at least non-experimental social science research---should not be taken at face value. Among three dozen studies I reviewed, I obtained or reconstructed the data and code for eight. Replication and reanalysis revealed significant methodological concerns in seven and led to major reinterpretations of four. These studies endured much tougher scrutiny from me than they did from peer reviewers in order to make it into academic journals. Yet given the stakes in lives and dollars, the added scrutiny was worth it. So from the point of view of decision makers who rely on academic research, today&#39;s peer review processes fall well short of the optimal.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of this post elaborates on those conclusions. <!--break--></p>

<h2>The scale of incarceration in the U.S.</h2>

<p>Long ago when the world was young, I followed my girlfriend to Philadelphia. Biking to work, I sometimes noticed, embedded in the drab urban fabric of asphalt and rowhouses, a massive, crenelated, slit-windowed, medieval fortress. Not till 2015, when I returned with my family, did I learn that it was the former Eastern State Penitentiary, an old prison built on the theories of a criminal justice reform movement of 200 years ago. It is a <a href=""https://www.easternstate.org/"">fantastic museum</a> now: you must go. When we visited, we finished our self-guided audio tours in an interior courtyard, where inmates were once permitted to exercise. Now installed there is the Big Graph, a sculpture that puts America&#39;s incarceration rate in historical and global perspective. This photograph of the Big Graph shows <strong>prisoners per 100,000 Americans by decade for 1900--2010</strong>:</p>

<p>{image_1}</p>

<p>In 1970, <a href=""https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1973/compendia/statab/94ed/1973-03.pdf#page=74"">196,000 people resided in American prisons</a>, and another <a href=""https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1973/compendia/statab/94ed/1973-03.pdf#page=75"">161,000 in jails</a>, which worked out to 174 inmates per 100,000 people. In 2015, <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20170113150140/https:/www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus15.pdf#page=2"">1.53 million people lived in U.S. prisons and 728,000 in jails</a>, or 673 per 100,000. The next photo captures the side of that tall red bar, which depicts <strong>prisoners per 100,000 residents by country in 2010</strong>:</p>

<p>{image_2}</p>

<p>In fact, the U.S. may be #2 behind North Korea, but that country is presumably left off the Big Graph for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisons_in_North_Korea"">lack of reliable data</a>.</p>

<p>Experts disagree about what caused the incarcerated population to mushroom. <a href=""https://www.fordham.edu/info/23171/john_pfaff"">John Pfaff of the Fordham School of Law</a> sees a <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L6SLKK8"">change in prosecutor behavior</a> as key: prosecutors file more charges per arrest than they did in the 1970s. Alfred Blumstein and Allen Beck, on the other hand, <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/1147683"">assign roughly equal responsibility</a> to increased commitments per arrests, which prosecutors would have contributed to, and lengthened prison stays. Regardless, I think there is little doubt that a &quot;tough on crime&quot; movement, including the &quot;war on drugs&quot; initiated by Richard Nixon, caused much of the expansion. Laws were passed to toughen sentences. More was spent on arresting people and keeping them in prison. For whatever reasons of principle and politics, prosecutors became more aggressive. And there was a racial dimension: the newly imprisoned were <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20170303050204/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p15.pdf#page=8"">disproportionately black</a>.</p>

<p>The more practical question for Open Philanthropy is not about the causes of the rise, but the consequences of a fall. Putting fewer people behind bars should expand liberty and save government money. But might it also increase crime? Or might it <em>reduce</em> crime, if the prison experience is itself a source of criminality?</p>

<p>A good way to organize our inquiry is to start with a simple observation. Incarceration can be thought of as affecting crime before, during, and after: before, in that stiffer sentences may deter crime before it would happen; during, in that people inside prison cannot physically commit crime outside; and after, in that having been incarcerated may shift one&rsquo;s chance of reoffending. The first is called &ldquo;deterrence,&rdquo; the second &ldquo;incapacitation.&rdquo; The third I call simply &ldquo;aftereffects.&rdquo; Conceptually, the aftereffects channel is most diverse. Prisons may rehabilitate inmates, by &quot;scaring them straight,&quot; or teaching them job skills, or treating their addictions. Or doing time may be criminogenic. Having been imprisoned may make it harder for people to find legal employment, may psychologically alienate them from mainstream society, and may strengthen their social bonds with criminals, all of which <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/599202"">could raise recidivism</a>. (Aftereffects are conventionally termed &quot;specific deterrence,&quot; on the idea that having been in prison strengthens deterrence: once bitten twice shy. But I think it&#39;s better to approach the evidence with theory-neutral terminology.)</p>

<p>In reviewing studies that study one or more of these channels from incarceration to crime, I restricted myself to potentially high-credibility studies: ones that exploit randomized experiments, or else &ldquo;quasi-experiments&rdquo; that arise incidentally from the machinations of the criminal justice system. And I put special weight on the eight studies whose data and computer code I could touch with my own hands, as it were. As I mentioned, my replication and reanalysis of these studies led me to revise my readings of some. (<a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/The-impacts-of-incarceration-on-crime-10.pdf#page=20"">Section 3.3</a> of the full report describes my search for data and code.)</p>

<p>On the basis of the evidence, gathered, checked, and distilled, here is my reasoning that decarceration in the United States today is unlikely to increase crime:</p>

<ol>
	<li><em><a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/deterrence-de-minimis"">Deterrence is de minimis</a></em>. <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150910195737/http:/mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/ThreeStrikes.pdf"">Eric Helland and Alex Tabarrok&rsquo;s study</a> of California&rsquo;s tough <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-strikes_law"">&ldquo;Three Strikes and You&rsquo;re Out&rdquo; sentencing law</a> suggests that each 10% increase in prospective sentences cut crime by 1% through deterrence, for a modest &ldquo;elasticity&rdquo; of &minus;0.1. The other replicable deterrence study, <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20130420101002/https:/www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/dabrams/workingpapers/Deterrence12312011.pdf"">by David Abrams</a>, looks at two kinds of laws adopted by many states: laws that set mandatory minimum sentences for certain crimes, and laws that raise sentences for crimes that involve a gun. In particular, the Abrams study checks whether rates of gun-involved assault and robbery fell right after either type of law was passed. Two types of law and two kinds of crime make for four combinations; the study finds an impact in one of the four, also with an elasticity of about &minus;0.1. But my reanalyses of the two studies calls even those mild impacts into question.</li>
	<li><em><a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/incapacitation-how-much-does-putting-people-inside-prison-cut-crime-outside"">Incapacitation is real</a></em>. Putting people in prison reduces crime outside of prison for the duration of their stays. Of course, putting more people in prison also causes more crime <em>in</em> prison. Credible estimates of incapacitation---defined here as the crime reduction outside of prisons---vary by context. Especially salient to today&#39;s criminal justice reform movement is the experience of California after the 2011 <a href=""http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/realignment/"">&ldquo;realignment&rdquo; reform</a>, which reduced confinement of people convicted of non-serious, non-sexual, nonviolent offenses. Revisiting the <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20160608171803/https:/gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/lofstrom_and_raphael_journal_article_Jan_2015.pdf"">work of Magnus Lofstrom and Steven Raphael</a>, I estimate that each person-year of reduced incarceration caused 6.7 more property crimes in the state&mdash;burglary, general theft, motor vehicle theft&mdash;among which the impact on motor vehicle thefts is clearest, at 1.2.</li>
	<li><em><a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/aftereffects-us-evidence-says-doing-more-time-typically-leads-more-crime-after"">Aftereffects appear harmful more often than not</a>:</em> more time in prison, more crime after prison. In particular, all but one of the five studies that compare incapacitation and aftereffects in the same context find that any short-run crime drop from putting people behind bars is at least cancelled out by more crime when they get out.{footnote_1} For example, Donald Green and Daniel Winik <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150430210144/http:/isps.yale.edu/sites/default/files/publication/2012/12/ISPS10-041.pdf"">find</a> that drug defendants in Washington, DC, who happened to appear before longer-sentencing judges were at least as likely to be rearrested within four years as those appearing before shorter-sentencing judges&mdash;even though the first group spent more of those four years in prison, when they could not be rearrested.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, it seems, incarceration&rsquo;s &ldquo;before&rdquo; effect is mild or zero while the &ldquo;after&rdquo; typically cancels out the &ldquo;during.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since my conclusion is uncertain and may be biased---or may at least look that way---I also develop a devil&rsquo;s-advocate position. From the evidence gathered here, how could one most persuasively contend that decarceration would endanger the public? I think the strongest argument would discard as biased my critical reanalysis of the two studies finding mild deterrence (item 1). It would then invoke the minority of aftereffects studies that contradict item 3 above, notably the <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024047/http:/scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/kuziemko/files/inmates_release.pdf"">Ilyana Kuziemko</a> and <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1093/aler/ahs010"">Peter Ganong</a> papers finding harmful aftereffects in Georgia (setting aside my <a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/The-impacts-of-incarceration-on-crime-10.pdf#page=102"">critical reanalyses</a> of those as well). Then, incarceration would be seen as reducing crime before, during, and after.</p>

<p>If the devil&rsquo;s advocate is right that putting fewer people in prison causes more crime outside of prison, the increase might still be small enough that most people would view the tradeoff as worthwhile. After all, decarceration saves taxpayers money, increases the liberty of and economic productivity of erstwhile prisoners, and reduces disruption of their families and communities. To explore this possible trade-off, the report closes with a cost-benefit analysis.</p>

<p>Overall, I estimate the societal benefit of decarceration at $92,000 per person-year of averted confinement. That figure is dominated by taxpayer savings and the money value of gained liberty. The crime increase perceived by the devil&rsquo;s advocate translates into $22,000&ndash;$92,000, depending on the method used to express crime&rsquo;s harm in dollars. I argue that the methodology behind the high end of that range is less reliable. It works from <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.293153"">surveys that asked people how much they would pay for a 10% crime cut</a>, even though most Americans <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20160707230210/https:/blackboard.angelo.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/LFA/CSS/Course%20Material/BOR6334/readings/Critical%20Response/CRP%204%20by%20Piquero%20et%20al..pdf"">do not know how much crime occurs near them, thus what it would mean to cut it 10%</a>. But if we accept the high figure, then in the worst-case valuation of the worst-case scenario plausibly rooted in the evidence, decarceration is about break-even. Given the great uncertainties in that calculation&mdash;about the crime impact of decarceration, the money value of crime victimization, the value of liberty&mdash;the precision in the worst-case assessment ($92,000 in costs, $92,000 in benefits) is an illusion. The worst case should be viewed as roughly break-even.</p>

"710","Our Progress in 2016 and Plans for 2017","<p><em>Throughout the post, &ldquo;we&rdquo; refers to GiveWell and Good Ventures, who work as partners on the <a href=""/research-and-ideas/blog/introducing-the-open-philanthropy-project"">Open Philanthropy Project</a>.</em></p>

<p>This post compares our progress with the <a href=""/research-and-ideas/blog/our-progress-in-2015-and-plans-for-2016"">goals we set forth a year ago</a>, and lays out our plans for the coming year. In brief:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Our main goal for 2016 was increasing our level of grantmaking, and we focused on this rather than hiring. The team expanded little, but we recommended{footnote_1} over $100 million worth of grants in 2016, compared to under $20 million in 2015. We briefly summarize our activity in each of the major causes we worked on below. In most cases, it is too early to see impact from our work, but in a couple of cases there appears to be some early impact.</li>
	<li>We had three Scientific Advisors - <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/chris-somerville"">Chris Somerville</a>, <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/heather-youngs"">Heather Youngs</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/daniel-martin-alarcon"">Daniel Martin-Alarcon</a> - start in mid-2016. (Chris was previously consulting on a part-time basis.) We still have a good deal of work to do before setting focus areas within scientific research.</li>
	<li>We did not complete the spinoff of the Open Philanthropy Project into a separate organization; this turned out to be more time-consuming than anticipated. We anticipate completing it by mid-2017.</li>
	<li>We expect to be able to continue recommending grants at a pace of $100+ million per year (though with considerable year-to-year variation) and maintaining current quality (i.e. grants that we consider reasonably well-investigated and good expected value for money). We now have a much more tangible sense of what the day-to-day key questions and operational challenges are for giving in this range. Many new questions and challenges have come up.</li>
	<li>At this stage, we now see greater importance for a number of issues including <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later-2016-update#Plans_for_the_coming_year"">the question of how much grantmaking to aim for in each of our focus areas and how to decide when a grant is worth making</a>, our approach to public communications, and how to make our grantmaking process more streamlined and systematic. In particular, we believe that we will gain a lot from sharpening our thinking on several points related to <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/worldview-diversification"">worldview diversification</a> - and the relative appeal of different worldviews - before increasing our annual giving level much more.</li>
	<li>For 2017, we don&#39;t plan to focus on scaling up our program staff or grantmaking. Instead, we expect to maintain them at roughly the same level while making significant progress on the items listed in the previous point.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Progress in 2016</h2>

<p>Last year&#39;s post <a href=""{site_url}research-and-ideas/blog/our-progress-in-2015-and-plans-for-2016/#Plans for 2016"">laid out plans for 2016</a>. This section follows the order of that section, and quotes from it to allow comparisons between our plans and our progress.</p>

<h3>Grantmaking</h3>

<p>In the intro to <a href=""/research-and-ideas/blog/our-progress-in-2015-and-plans-for-2016"">last year&#39;s post</a>, we wrote:</p>

<blockquote>This year, we have a general goal of focusing on making grants in the most outstanding causes we&rsquo;ve found. This is a departure from past years&rsquo; goals, which revolved around building knowledge and staff capacity. We expect to prioritize building knowledge and staff capacity again in the future, but we think this is a good year to focus on increasing our grantmaking. We currently are bottlenecked in terms of management capacity, and we believe that focusing on grantmaking will likely lead to a lot of learning that will inform future hiring and capacity building.</blockquote>

<p>2016 progress was consistent with this: we did little hiring, and increased grantmaking greatly. We recommended over $100 million worth of grants. (A comparable figure for 2015 would have been under $20 million.)</p>

<h4>Potential risks from advanced AI</h4>

<p><a href=""{site_url}research-and-ideas/blog/our-progress-in-2015-and-plans-for-2016/#Plans for 2016"">Last year</a>, we wrote:</p>

<blockquote>Potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence will be a major priority for 2016 ... Daniel Dewey will work on it full-time, and Nick Beckstead and I [Holden] will both put significant time into it as well. Some other staff will be contributing smaller amounts of time as appropriate ... We won&rsquo;t necessarily recommend a large amount of grantmaking in this cause, though it&rsquo;s possible that we will. Our main goal is to lay the groundwork for more grantmaking in the future.</blockquote>

<p>We recommended approximately $11 million in grants, including <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/uc-berkeley-center-for-human-compatible-ai"">$5.56 million to start UC Berkeley&#39;s Center for Human-Compatible AI</a>, $2.4 million to Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (writeup forthcoming), <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/future-of-humanity-institute-general-support"">approximately $2 million to the Future of Humanity Institute</a>, and <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/machine-intelligence-research-institute-general-support"">$500,000 to Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a>. Our grantmaking has focused on (a) creating more spaces for work on technical safety research in academia; (b) &quot;shovel-ready&quot; grants to existing organizations. We also put substantial effort into writing up our <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence-philanthropic-opportunity"">views on the topic</a>, making connections with people in relevant fields, and developing a general grant process that we&#39;ll be using for more grants on technical safety work. We feel much better informed about this area, with a clearer sense of our future potential activities, than we did a year ago. We still consider it a highly promising philanthropic area, and we plan to continue allocating partial time from several staff (especially Nick Beckstead, Helen Toner and myself) as well as all of Daniel Dewey&#39;s time. Working this way in 2016 did not require cutting or suspending any other top-priority work, and we don&#39;t expect it to in 2017 either. We see this as a very long-time-horizon cause, and we don&#39;t think we can point to tangible impact of our work yet.</p>

<h4>Biosecurity and pandemic preparedness</h4>

<p><a href=""{site_url}research-and-ideas/blog/our-progress-in-2015-and-plans-for-2016/#Plans for 2016"">Last year</a>, we wrote:</p>

<blockquote>We hope to recommend at least $10 million worth of grants in the area of biosecurity in the next year. A full-time Program Officer will be starting work in this area soon.</blockquote>

<p>With <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/jaime-yassif"">Jaime Yassif</a> as our new Program Officer who started in mid-2016, we&#39;ve recommended a bit over $21 million in grants in this area. <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/chs-biosecurity-global-health-security-global-catastrophic-risks"">$16 million of that was for the Center for Health Security</a>; other major grants included <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/blue-ribbon-study-panel-on-biodefense-general-support"">$1.8 million for the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense</a> and <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/upmc-center-for-health-security-elbi"">$2.7 million for the Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity Initiative</a>. We focused initially on &quot;shovel-ready&quot; grants to organizations that relevant staff had pre-existing knowledge of. We then spent some time setting priorities more systematically. In the near term our top three priorities will be: (1) risk assessment; (2) managing the risks posed by advances in biotechnology, its global spread and decreasing barriers to access; and (3) building capacity for independent policy research and advocacy. In the coming year we plan to refine our strategic priorities and set longer term goals for the program. Most of our grantmaking in this cause was done after mid-year and has aimed to build capacity for key institutions; we don&#39;t think we can point to tangible impact of this work yet.</p>

<h4>Criminal Justice Reform</h4>

<p><a href=""{site_url}research-and-ideas/blog/our-progress-in-2015-and-plans-for-2016/#Plans for 2016"">Last year</a>, we wrote:</p>

<blockquote>We hope to recommend at least $10 million worth of grants in each of criminal justice reform and farm animal welfare. We have cause-specific staffers leading our work in both areas.</blockquote>

<p>We recommended about $20 million worth of Criminal Justice Reform grants in 2016.{footnote_2} Priorities include sentencing reform (including <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/alliance-for-safety-and-justice-general-support1"">$3 million for the Alliance for Safety and Justice</a>), organizing (including <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/faith-in-texas-general-support"">Faith in Texas</a>, <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/mijente-criminal-justice-reform"">Mijente</a> and <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/the-ordinary-people-society-general-support"">The Ordinary People Society</a>), prosecutorial accountability and reform (such as <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/accountable-justice-project-general-support"">The Accountable Justice Project</a>), and piloting and promoting alternatives to incarceration (such as <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/impact-justice-restorative-justice-project"">restorative justice</a>). We expect to publish significantly more content on this topic in the coming months. We&#39;ve seen several cases where our grants may have had an impact, and will likely write more about some of these in the future (while some are best not to share publicly). So far, we believe the most significant case is that of a <a href=""https://www.allianceforsafetyandjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FINAL-IL-RELEASE.pdf"">recent bill signed in Illinois</a> that our grantee, the Alliance for Safety and Justice, estimates will result in approximately a 3000-person reduction in the prison population (we plan to discuss this in more detail in a future post). It is our understanding that ASJ developed the strategy for the bill, and worked very closely with the bill&#39;s champion Jehan Gordon-Booth, to cover all bases necessary in the state to get it passed. It passed with strong bipartisan majority and support from key law enforcement associations. Our grant to ASJ constituted 54% of its income in 2016; we believe this grant substantially increased the scope of ASJ&#39;s work, and that the work ASJ did in Illinois is among the work that would have been unlikely to occur without our support.</p>

<h4>Farm Animal Welfare</h4>

<p>As quoted above, last year we wrote that we hoped to recommend at least $10 million worth of grants in this area. We recommended about $15 million worth of grants in 2016 (not including an additional $2.5 million we recommended in 2015). This included about $3 million each to Mercy for Animals (grants <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/mercy-for-animals-broiler-chicken-welfare-corporate-campaigns"">here</a>, <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/mercy-for-animals-international-cage-free-advocacy"">here</a> and <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/mercy-for-animals-corporate-cage-free-campaigns"">here</a>) and The Humane League (<a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/the-humane-league-general-support"">here</a>, <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/the-humane-league-international-cage-free-advocacy"">here</a>, and <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/the-humane-league-corporate-cage-free-campaigns"">here</a>). Our main focus was on corporate campaigns for better treatment of both layer and broiler chickens, both in the U.S. and abroad. Our grantees have now secured cage-free pledges from all of the top 25 US grocers, foodservice companies, and food manufacturers, and 16 of the top 20 fast food chains, which will benefit &gt;250M hens annually once implemented. They have also secured global cage-free pledges from the world&rsquo;s two largest foodservice companies, the world&rsquo;s largest discount grocery chain, and several of the world&rsquo;s largest hotel chains, and regional cage-free pledges from Latin America&rsquo;s largest fast food operators and France and Britain&rsquo;s largest grocers. And they have secured commitments from the largest US foodservice operators and several fast food chains to reduce the suffering of &gt;200M broiler chickens annually. We also supported work on fish welfare, work on promoting animal product alternatives, and nascent work to build stronger farm animal welfare organizations in China and India. We view these as long-term efforts and don&rsquo;t expect to see tangible progress from these grants soon.</p>

<h4>Other U.S. policy</h4>

<p><a href=""{site_url}research-and-ideas/blog/our-progress-in-2015-and-plans-for-2016/#Plans for 2016"">Last year</a>, we wrote:</p>

<blockquote>Alexander Berger&rsquo;s top priority continues to be supporting Chloe and Lewis&rsquo;s work (on criminal justice reform and farm animal welfare, respectively). We&rsquo;re less set on what his other priorities will be, but with his remaining time, he is likely to work on some combination of:
<ul>
	<li>exploring funding opportunities around a cluster of science and technology policy issues, such as policy around emerging technologies (potentially including advanced artificial intelligence) and other topics related to science policy and infrastructure.</li>
	<li>investigating a set of funding opportunities in macroeconomic stabilization policy.</li>
	<li>maintaining or expanding upon our grants in immigration policy and land use reform.</li>
</ul>
I&rsquo;d guess that his work (aside from supporting Chloe and Lewis) will result in about $10 million worth of grant recommendations in 2016, but with high uncertainty.</blockquote>

<p>Alexander spent less time on the above priorities than anticipated, instead focusing on supporting Chloe and Lewis, helping Open Philanthropy move toward spinning out as an independent organization, and working with the science team on grants around the use of gene drives in malaria control (discussed more below). We recommended about $2 million in grants to think tanks to work on <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/macroeconomic-policy"">macroeconomic stabilization policy</a> (grant writeups <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/center-on-budget-and-policy-priorities-full-employment-project-2016"">here</a>, <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/economic-policy-institute-macroeconomic-policy-research"">here</a>, <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/roosevelt-institute-macroeconomic-policy-research"">here</a>, <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/peterson-institute-for-international-economics-macroeconomic-stabilization"">here</a> and <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/center-for-american-progress-macroeconomic-stabilization"">here</a>), as well as a renewal for <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/center-for-popular-democracy-fed-up-campaign-2016"">Fed Up</a> (writeup forthcoming). We also recommended $1-2 million for <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy"">immigration policy</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/land-use-reform"">land use reform</a>. We mostly think it is too early to see especially clear impact from these grants. We plan to lower the priority of new grantmaking (as opposed to renewals for existing grantees) in <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/macroeconomic-policy"">macroeconomic stabilization policy</a>, <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy"">immigration policy</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/land-use-reform"">land use reform</a> this year. We&#39;ve made a relatively small number of grants in these causes, and this is related to the fact that Alexander&#39;s attention has been divided between multiple priorities. (We&#39;ve also updated in favor of the &quot;expert&quot; model of philanthropy described in <a href=""/research-and-ideas/blog/expert-philanthropy-vs-broad-philanthropy"">this blog post</a>.) For now, we anticipate mostly keeping our work in these areas in &ldquo;maintenance mode,&rdquo; while Alexander works on some other priorities (more below).</p>

<h4>Scientific research</h4>

<p><a href=""{site_url}research-and-ideas/blog/our-progress-in-2015-and-plans-for-2016/#Plans for 2016"">Last year</a>, we wrote:</p>

<blockquote>We still have a substantial amount of work to do before we&rsquo;ll be ready to set focus areas within scientific research. We don&rsquo;t plan to set a particular goal for 2016, because (a) we are allocating senior generalist time to potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence; and (b) we think time spent on scientific research will be much more productive after our scientific advisors come on board.</blockquote>

<p>We had three Scientific Advisors - <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/chris-somerville"">Chris Somerville</a>, <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/heather-youngs"">Heather Youngs</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/daniel-martin-alarcon"">Daniel Martin-Alarcon</a> - start in mid-2016. We&#39;ve been investigating several areas of interest but have not completed any investigations yet. We have also:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Recommended a large grant for work on gene drives that might reduce malarial burdens (main writeup forthcoming; one grant is <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/fnih-working-group-on-malaria-gene-drive-testing-path"">written up here</a>).</li>
	<li>Reviewed over 100 grant proposals that were submitted to the <a href=""https://commonfund.nih.gov/tra"">NIH&#39;s Transformative Research Award Program</a> and not funded, and we plan to recommending funding for some. We see this as a way of getting a very broad view of what sort of ambitious and unfunded ideas are out there in the life sciences.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Effective altruism</h4>

<p><a href=""{site_url}research-and-ideas/blog/our-progress-in-2015-and-plans-for-2016/#Plans for 2016"">Last year</a>, we wrote:</p>

<blockquote>There is a strong possibility that we will make grants aimed at helping grow the effective altruist community in 2016. Nick Beckstead, who has strong connections and context in this community, would lead this work.</blockquote>

<p>We recommended about $1 million to <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/founders-pledge-general-support"">Founders&#39; Pledge</a>, and $1.4 million for <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/center-for-applied-rationality-sparc"">SPARC</a> and <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/center-for-applied-rationality-general-support"">Center for Applied Rationality</a>. We also made recommendations for <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/machine-intelligence-research-institute-general-support"">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> and Future of Humanity Institute (writeup forthcoming), though we&#39;ve classified these as falling under <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence"">potential risks from advanced AI</a> rather than under effective altruism. We are hoping to recommend grants for <a href=""https://80000hours.org"">80,000 Hours</a> and <a href=""https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/"">Centre for Effective Altruism</a> soon. At that point we believe we will have covered most of the major opportunities in this area, but we will continue to keep an eye out. We expect to have substantive updates on these organizations&#39; progress and the impact of our funds within about a year, but we don&#39;t at the moment.</p>

<h4>Other grantmaking</h4>

<blockquote>As discussed above, we have significantly better capacity - and context - for evaluating potential grants than we&rsquo;ve had in the past. As such, we are making a moderate effort to identify potential grants that don&rsquo;t fit neatly into an existing focus area but are highly &ldquo;shovel-ready&rdquo; (in the sense that we can identify a specific potential grantee) and appear strong overall based on the knowledge we&rsquo;ve picked up in the course of our many cause investigations and discussions. We don&rsquo;t expect to make a large number of these grants, but we expect to make some.</blockquote>

<p>We recommended about $5.5 million in grants on outstanding opportunities to mitigate risks from climate change: $2.5 million for research on solar geoengineering (writeup forthcoming) and <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grants/climateworks-foundation-kigali-cooling-efficiency-program"">$3 million to encourage reduction in hydrofluorocarbon emissions</a>. We also made about $1 million worth of other &quot;one-off grants&quot; (see <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/project-peanut-butter-ready-to-use-therapeutic-food-rct"">here</a>, <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/university-of-pennsylvania-philip-tetlock-on-forecasting"">here</a> and <a href=""/our-portfolio/grants/university-of-cape-town-geomagnetics-research"">here</a>). We wrote about our <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later-2016-update"">recommendation</a> to Good Ventures to grant $50 million to <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/charities/topcharities"">GiveWell&#39;s top charities</a>. We aren&#39;t including this figure when we say (above) that &quot;We recommended over $100 million worth of grants&quot; in 2016.</p>

<h3>Progress on other fronts</h3>

	<li>We hope that by the end of 2016, the Open Philanthropy Project will operate as an independent organization from GiveWell, with its own employees and financials, though some individuals will continue to do work for both organizations.</li>

We also continue to collect relevant cases informally. By the end of 2016, we hope to publish a summary of what we&rsquo;ve learned about the history of philanthropy, which will be a significant update from our <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/philanthropys-success-stories"">2012 post on the subject</a>.</li>
	<li>We hope to continue improving cross-cutting aspects of how we work. Our interests include improving our process for producing public writeups, refining our approach to cost-effectiveness estimates and comparing the good accomplished by different grants, refining our thinking about <a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/25/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later/"">how much giving we should recommend to GiveWell&#39;s top charities</a>, and finding ways to improve our general forecasting abilities (since our grantmaking decisions rely on views about what developments are likely in the future).

</blockquote>

<p>The first of these - spinning off into an independent organization - turned out to be more complex and involved than we had anticipated. We put significant time into it in 2016 and are planning to complete the spinoff by mid-2017. We put less time than anticipated into the other points listed above. We did not publish an updated writeup on the history of philanthropy, and may or may not do so in 2017. We made some progress on the third point, including a <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-how-were-thinking-about-openness-and-information-sharing"">revised approach to information sharing</a>, <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/efforts-improve-accuracy-our-judgments-and-forecasts"">starting to explore best practices for forecasting</a>, improvements to our grantmaking process and new hires who focus on it, and an internal &quot;Program Officer guide&quot; that we expect to eventually create a public version of.</p>

<h2><a id=""takeaways_from_2016"" name=""takeaways_from_2016""></a>Takeaways from 2016</h2>

<p>Speaking broadly, the main significance of 2016 for us is that we greatly increased our grantmaking, to the point where it is now <a href=""http://www.fcpubhub.net/findfunders/topfunders/top100giving.html"">comparable to that of major foundations</a>. We expect to be able to maintain this pace and quality of giving recommendations (i.e. $100+ million per year, though with substantial year-to-year variation, from grants that we consider reasonably well-investigated and good expected value for money). If we had a goal of increasing the annual level of grantmaking further, we think we could fairly easily do so, and this has affected how we think about <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later-2016-update#Plans_for_the_coming_year"">giving now vs. later</a>. We now have a much more tangible sense of what the day-to-day key questions and operational challenges are for giving in this range. Many new questions and challenges have come up. At this level of giving, we now see more importance for careful public communications, the need for a more streamlined and systematic grantmaking process, and the need for more thinking about <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later-2016-update#Plans_for_the_coming_year"">the question of how much grantmaking to aim for in each of our focus areas and how to decide when a grant is worth making</a>. In particular, we believe that we will gain a lot from sharpening our thinking on several points related to <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/worldview-diversification"">worldview diversification</a> - and the relative appeal of different worldviews - before increasing our annual giving level much more.</p>

<h2><a id=""plans_for_2017"" name=""plans_for_2017""></a>Plans for 2017</h2>

<p>For reasons outlined above, we aren&#39;t planning much staff expansion in 2017. We plan to continue grantmaking roughly as we have been, while trying to improve the underlying processes and intellectual framework.</p>

<h3><a id=""continued_grantmaking"" name=""continued_grantmaking""></a>Continued grantmaking</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Major focus areas with full-time staff</strong>: we expect to continue our work on <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence"">potential risks of advanced AI</a>, <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/biosecurity"">biosecurity and pandemic preparedness</a>, <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/criminal-justice-reform"">criminal justice reform</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/farm-animal-welfare"">farm animal welfare</a> much as we did in 2016. I would guess that the total amounts given in these causes will be broadly similar to what they were in 2016, and it&#39;s hard to say whether they&#39;ll be higher or lower for a given cause, because we don&#39;t know what sorts of opportunities we will find. My best guess is that the four causes combined will account for around $70-90 million in recommendations.</li>
	<li><strong>Other US policy grantmaking.</strong> We believe that the results of the 2016 elections have changed the overall landscape for U.S. policy (though not in a way that substantially alters the promise of criminal justice reform or farm animal welfare). <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/alexander-berger"">Alexander Berger</a> plans to put less emphasis on finding new grantees in <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy"">immigration reform</a>, <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/macroeconomic-policy"">macroeconomic stabilization policy</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/land-use-reform"">land use reform</a>, while focusing on maintaining existing grants in those areas. He plans to spend more of his time exploring new potential Open Phil policy priorities in light of the 2016 elections. It&#39;s hard to say what level of grantmaking this will lead to.</li>
	<li><strong>Effective altruism.</strong> We now consider this to be <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/other-areas"">among our focus areas</a>. We&#39;ve recommended (or will soon recommend) multi-year grants to the organizations we&#39;re most interested in supporting in this area. <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/nick-beckstead"">Nick Beckstead</a> will maintain relationships and continue keeping an eye out for new opportunities, including opportunities to provide further funding to existing grantees, though we won&#39;t necessarily make new grant recommendations in 2017 beyond the couple we&#39;re working on now.</li>
	<li><strong>Scientific research.</strong> We&#39;ve been working with our new full-time staff in this area for a few months, and feel that we still have a lot to learn about how best to investigate causes in this area. We hope to set focus areas by the end of 2017 or early 2018, though we still consider that a &quot;soft&quot; goal such that we will feel unsurprised if we don&#39;t achieve it. I expect that some grantmaking opportunities will come up in the meantime; we would like to recommend at least $10-20 million worth of grants while still choosing focus areas this year, including some of the &quot;transformative research award&quot; candidates mentioned above, and we plan to make larger grants if we can find outstanding opportunities (such as gene drives).</li>
	<li><strong>Other.</strong> <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/claire-zabel"">Claire Zabel</a> has been investigating potential &quot;one-off grants&quot; for <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks"">global catastrophic risks</a> other than the two mentioned above, particularly climate change and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/nuclear-weapons-policy"">nuclear weapons policy</a>. We don&rsquo;t yet know how much grantmaking this will result in.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I will not be surprised if 2017 grantmaking is lower than 2016 grantmaking, as there were some significant one-off grants in 2016 (particularly in the area of gene drives). But I&#39;d guess that we will recommend at least $100 million worth of grants, and I&#39;ll consider it quite surprising if we don&#39;t recommend at least $80 million worth.</p>

<h3><a id=""cause_prioritization_framework_and_last_dollar_analysis"" name=""cause_prioritization_framework_and_last_dollar_analysis""></a>Cause prioritization framework and &quot;last dollar&quot; analysis</h3>

<p>We <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later-2016-update#Plans_for_the_coming_year"">recently wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Our framework for &ldquo;giving now vs. later&rdquo; has gotten a lot more complex compared to last year&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s very far at this point from being as systematic as I would like. Currently, we apply the framework very loosely and informally ... In 2017, I hope to put significantly more time into the issues that were preliminarily addressed in this post, such as the value of the &ldquo;last dollar&rdquo; ...</blockquote>

<p>A <strong>major goal of 2017</strong> will be to reach and publish better-developed views on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Which <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/worldview-diversification"">worldviews</a> we find most plausible: for example, how we allocate resources between giving that primarily focuses on present-day human welfare vs. present-day animal welfare vs. <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks"">global catastrophic risks</a>.</li>
	<li>How we allocate resources among worldviews.</li>
	<li>How we determine whether it&#39;s <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later-2016-update"">better to make a given grant or save the money for a later date</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This work is likely to include addressing several of the <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/fundamental-questions-might-affect-our-grantmaking"">fundamental questions</a> we listed recently: how to compare cost-effectiveness across very different causes, how to make decisions under different kinds of uncertainty, how best to realize the benefits of <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/worldview-diversification"">worldview diversification</a>, and which types of beings <a href=""/research-and-ideas/blog/radical-empathy"">warrant our moral concern</a>. It may also include some degree of further investigation on the <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/moral-value-far-future"">moral value of the far future</a>, and the question of how likely it is that we can have non-negligible impact on humanity&#39;s long-term prospects. We hope this work will put us in better position to make systematic day-to-day decisions about our grantmaking, and to choose the best possible cause prioritization and funding allocation as we scale up our giving further.</p>

<h3><a id=""capacity_building"" name=""capacity_building""></a>Capacity building</h3>

<p>We hope to improve our staff capacity and processes on a few fronts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We&#39;re hoping to improve our grantmaking process, particularly the process of completing a writeup, grant agreement, and grant payment. (Currently, it often takes months from when we recommend a grant to when we finalize and announce the grant.) We recently hired <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/morgan-davis"">Morgan Davis</a> to help with this work, and may hire more people in line with this goal.</li>
	<li>We&#39;re hoping to hire a Director of Operations so that we can be in good position to build an operations team as we grow further in the future. Currently, we largely share operations capacity with <a href=""http://www.givewell.org"">GiveWell</a>.</li>
	<li>We&#39;re hoping to improve our communications capacity. Currently, we make many grants with relatively little sense for what <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later-2016-update#Non-monetary_costs_of_grants"">communications challenges</a> they might raise, and what we can do to minimize or mitigate such challenges. We are exploring the idea of more intensive engagements with communications firms, and/or hiring, in order to get better at this. Doing so might also improve our ability to create public communications about our work that are more digestible than the content we currently put out.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id=""other"" name=""other""></a>Other</h3>

<ul>
	<li>We expect to complete the process of becoming a separate organization from <a href=""http://www.givewell.org"">GiveWell</a> this year.</li>
	<li>We are becoming more interested in the idea of finding additional donors to partner on our work, whether it takes the form of funding good giving opportunities that aren&#39;t a fit for us, pooling resources, or simply sharing a lot of information. Part of our increased interest comes from our increased sense that we can spend a lot of money in a high-impact way. We don&#39;t have any particular goals on this front for 2017, but we expect to spend more time talking with major philanthropists and future major philanthropists than we did in 2016.</li>
	<li>We expect to very preliminarily start looking back at previous grants and doing self-assessment. However, we think it will be more productive to focus on this work a year or two from now. We expect most of our grants to take several years to have noticeable impact (if any), and the bulk of our grantmaking to date is now less than a year old.</li>
</ul>
","<p>Throughout this post, &quot;recommended&quot; means that a recommendation was made by an Open Phil grant investigator and approved by Cari and Holden. However, the recommendation is generally conditional on finalizing a grant agreement and completing due diligence, and in many cases the next step after this is a recommendation to a donor-advised fund that has final say in what grant (if any) is made. Grants are not posted to our <a href=""{site_url}our-portfolio/grants-database"">database</a> until completed, so in many cases the date of a grant&#39;s being &quot;recommended&quot; in the sense used here is different from the date that a grant appears in the database.</p>
|<p>Last year&#39;s review stated, &quot;We hope to recommend at least $10 million worth of grants in each of criminal justice reform and farm animal welfare. We have cause-specific staffers leading our work in both areas. (In each case, we&rsquo;d include grants already made in these areas - since late 2015, when both staffers joined - as part of the $10 million.)&quot; However, we decided that this accounting method is needlessly confusing, and we&#39;re now just listing numbers for calendar-year 2016.</p>

"679","Radical Empathy","<p><em>Throughout the post, &ldquo;we&rdquo; refers to GiveWell and Good Ventures, who work as partners on the <a href=""/research-and-ideas/blog/introducing-the-open-philanthropy-project"">Open Philanthropy Project</a>.</em></p>

<p>One theme of our work is trying to help populations that many people don&#39;t feel are worth helping at all. We&#39;ve seen <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/initial-grants-to-support-corporate-cage-free-reforms"">major opportunities to improve the welfare of factory-farmed animals</a>, because so few others are trying to do it. When working on <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy "">immigration reform</a>, we&#39;ve seen big debates about how immigration affects <a href=""http://davidroodman.com/blog/2014/09/03/the-domestic-economic-impacts-of-immigration"">wages for people already in the U.S.</a>, and much less discussion of how it affects immigrants. Even our interest in <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-health-and-development"">global health and development</a> is fairly unusual: many Americans may agree that <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas"">charitable dollars go further overseas</a>, but prefer to give domestically because they so strongly prioritize people in their own country compared to people in the rest of the world.{footnote_1}</p>

<p>The question, &quot;Who deserves empathy and moral concern?&quot; is central for us. We think it&#39;s one of the most important questions for effective giving, and generally. Unfortunately, we don&#39;t think we can trust conventional wisdom and intuition on the matter: history has too many cases where entire populations were dismissed, mistreated and deprived of basic rights for reasons that fit the conventional wisdom of the time but today look indefensible. Instead, we aspire to <strong>radical empathy</strong>: working hard to extend empathy to everyone it should be extended to, even when when it is unusual or seems strange to do so.</p>

<p>To clarify the choice of terminology:</p>

<ul>
	<li>&quot;Radical&quot; is intended as the opposite of &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;conventional.&quot; It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean &quot;extreme&quot; or &quot;all-inclusive&quot;: we don&#39;t extend empathy to everyone and everything (this would leave us essentially no basis for making decisions about morality). It refers to working hard to make the best choices we can, without anchoring to convention.</li>
	<li>&quot;Empathy&quot; is intended to capture the idea that one <em>could</em> imagine oneself in another&#39;s position, and recognizes the other as having experiences that are worthy of consideration. It is not intended to refer to <em>literally feeling</em> what another feels, and is therefore distinct from the &quot;empathy&quot; critiqued in <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Against-Empathy-Case-Rational-Compassion-ebook/dp/B01CY2LCZI/"">Against Empathy</a> (a book that acknowledges the multiple meanings of the term and explicitly focuses on one).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conventional wisdom and intuition aren&#39;t good enough</h2>

<p>In <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B005646EGY/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"">The Expanding Circle</a>, Peter Singer discusses how, over the course of history, &quot;The circle of altruism has broadened from the family and tribe to the nation and race ... to all human beings&quot; (and adds that &quot;The process should not stop there&quot;).{footnote_2} By today&#39;s standards, the earliest cases he describes are striking:</p>

<blockquote>At first [the] insider/ outsider distinction applied even between the citizens of neighboring Greek city-states; thus there is a tombstone of the mid-fifth century B.C. which reads:<br />
<br />
<em>This memorial is set over the body of a very good man. Pythion, from Megara, slew seven men and broke off seven spear points in their bodies . . . This man, who saved three Athenian regiments . . . having brought sorrow to no one among all men who dwell on earth, went down to the underworld felicitated in the eyes of all.</em><br />
<br />
This is quite consistent with the comic way in which Aristophanes treats the starvation of the Greek enemies of the Athenians, starvation which resulted from the devastation the Athenians had themselves inflicted. Plato, however, suggested an advance on this morality: he argued that Greeks should not, in war, enslave other Greeks, lay waste their lands or raze their houses; they should do these things only to non-Greeks. These examples could be multiplied almost indefinitely. The ancient Assyrian kings boastfully recorded in stone how they had tortured their non-Assyrian enemies and covered the valleys and mountains with their corpses. Romans looked on barbarians as beings who could be captured like animals for use as slaves or made to entertain the crowds by killing each other in the Colosseum. In modern times Europeans have stopped treating each other in this way, but less than two hundred years ago some still regarded Africans as outside the bounds of ethics, and therefore a resource which should be harvested and put to useful work. Similarly Australian aborigines were, to many early settlers from England, a kind of pest, to be hunted and killed whenever they proved troublesome.{footnote_3}</blockquote>

<p>The end of the quote transitions to more recent, familiar failures of morality. In recent centuries, extreme racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry - including slavery - have been practiced explicitly and without apology, and often widely accepted by the most respected people in society.</p>

<p>From today&#39;s vantage point, these seem like extraordinarily shameful behaviors, and people who were early to reject them - such as early abolitionists and early feminists - look to have done extraordinary amounts of good. But at the time, looking to conventional wisdom and intuition wouldn&#39;t necessarily have helped avoid the shameful behaviors or seek out the helpful ones.</p>

<p>Today&#39;s norms seem superior in some respects. For example, racism is much more rarely explicitly advocated (which is not to say that it is rarely practiced). However, we think today&#39;s norms are still fundamentally inadequate for the question of who deserves empathy and moral concern. One sign of this is the discourse in the U.S. around immigrants, which tends to avoid explicit racism but often to embrace nationalism - to exclude or downplay the rights and concerns of people who aren&#39;t American citizens (and even more so, people who aren&#39;t in the U.S. but would like to be).</p>

<h3>Intellect vs. emotion</h3>

<p>I sometimes hear the sentiment that moral atrocities tend to come from thinking of morality abstractly, losing sight of the basic emotional basis for empathy, and distancing oneself from the people one&#39;s actions affect.</p>

<p>I think this is true in some cases, but importantly false in others. People living peaceful lives are often squeamish about violence, but it seems that this squeamishness can be overcome disturbingly quickly with experience. There are ample examples throughout history where large numbers of &quot;conventional&quot; people casually and even happily practiced direct cruelty and violence to those whose rights they didn&rsquo;t recognize.{footnote_4} Today, watching the casualness with which factory farm workers handle animals (as shown in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYwhSX3ltJg"">this gruesome video</a>), I doubt that <a href=""http://michaelpollan.com/articles-archive/an-animals-place/"">people would eat much less meat if they had to kill animals themselves</a>. I don&#39;t think the key is whether people see and feel the consequences of their actions. More important is whether they recognize those their actions affect as fellow persons, meriting moral consideration.</p>

<p>On the flipside, there seems to be at least some precedent for using logical reasoning to reach moral conclusions that look strikingly prescient in retrospect. For example, see Wikipedia on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham"">Jeremy Bentham</a>, who is known for basing his morality on the &nbsp;straightforward, quantitative logic of utilitarianism:</p>

<blockquote>He advocated individual and economic freedom, the separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and the decriminalising of homosexual acts. [My note: he lived from 1747-1832, well before most of these views were common.] He called for the abolition of slavery, the abolition of the death penalty, and the abolition of physical punishment, including that of children. He has also become known in recent years as an early advocate of animal rights.</blockquote>

<h2>Aspiring to radical empathy</h2>

<p>Who deserves empathy and moral concern? To the extent that we get this question wrong, we risk making atrocious choices. If we can get it right to an unusual degree, we might be able to do outsized amounts of good.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don&#39;t think it is necessarily easy to get it right, and we&#39;re far from confident that we are doing so. But here are a few principles we try to follow, in making our best attempt:</p>

<p><strong>Acknowledge our uncertainty.</strong> For example, we&#39;re quite unsure of where animals should fit into our moral framework. My own reflections and reasoning about philosophy of mind have, so far, seemed to indicate <em>against</em> the idea that e.g. chickens merit moral concern. And my intuitions value humans astronomically more. However, I don&#39;t think either my reflections or my intuitions are highly reliable, especially given that many thoughtful people disagree. And if chickens do indeed merit moral concern, the amount and extent of their mistreatment is staggering. With <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/worldview-diversification"">worldview diversification</a> in mind, I don&#39;t want us to pass up the potentially considerable opportunities to improve their welfare.</p>

<p>I think the uncertainty we have on this point warrants putting significant resources into <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/farm-animal-welfare"">farm animal welfare</a>, as well as working to generally avoid language that implies that only humans are morally relevant.{footnote_5}</p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t feel uncertain about all of our unusual choices. I&#39;m confident that differences in geography, nationality, and race ought not affect moral concern, and our giving should reflect this.</p>

<p><strong>Be extremely careful about too quickly dismissing &quot;strange&quot; arguments on this topic.</strong> Relatively small numbers of people argue that <a href=""http://reducing-suffering.org/do-bugs-feel-pain/"">insects</a>, and even <a href=""http://petrl.org/"">some algorithms run on today&#39;s computers</a>, merit moral concern. It&#39;s easy and intuitive to laugh these viewpoints off, since they seem so strange on their face and have such radical implications. But as argued above, I think we should be highly suspicious of our instincts to dismiss unusual viewpoints on who merits moral concern. And the stakes could certainly be high if these viewpoints turn out to be more reasonable than they appear at first.</p>

<p>So far I remain unconvinced that insects, or any algorithms run on today&#39;s computers, are strong candidates for meriting moral concern. But I think it&#39;s important to keep an open mind.</p>

<p><strong>Explore the idea of supporting deeper analysis.</strong> <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/luke-muehlhauser"">Luke Muehlhauser</a> is currently exploring the current state of research and argumentation on the question of who merits moral concern (which he calls the question of moral patienthood). It&#39;s possible that if we identify gaps in the literature, and opportunities to become better informed, we&#39;ll recommend funding further work. In the near future, work along these lines could affect our priorities within farm animal welfare - for example, it could affect how we prioritize work focused on improving treatment of fish. Ideally, our views on moral patienthood would be informed by an extensive literature drawing on as much deep reflection, empirical investigation and principled argumentation as possible. <strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t limit ourselves to the &ldquo;frontier.&rdquo; Widely recognized problems still do a great deal of damage.</strong> In our work we often find ourselves <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus"">focusing</a> on unconventional targets for charitable giving, such as farm animal welfare and potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence. This is because we often find that opportunities to do disproportionate amounts of good are in areas that have been, in our view, relatively neglected by others. However, our goal is to do the most good we can, not to seek out and support those causes which are most &ldquo;radical&rdquo; in our present society. When we see great opportunities to play a role in addressing harms in more widely-acknowledged areas -- for example, in the <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/criminal-justice-reform"">U.S. criminal justice system</a> -- we take them.</p>
","<p>For example, according to data from <a href=""https://givingusa.org/"">Giving USA</a>, only approximately 4% of US giving in 2015 was focused on international aid. (Reported by Charity Navigator <a href=""https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/cpid/42"">here</a>.)</p>

"588","Our Progress in 2015 and Plans for 2016","<p><em>Throughout the post, &ldquo;we&rdquo; refers to GiveWell and Good Ventures, who work as partners on the <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/introducing-the-open-philanthropy-project"">Open Philanthropy Project</a>.</em></p>

<p>This post compares our progress with the <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/open-philanthropy-project-progress-in-2014-and-plans-for-2015"">goals we set forth a year ago</a>, and lays out our plans for the coming year. In brief:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Our 2015 goals revolved mostly around building our staff capacity, and particularly around hiring. Broadly speaking, we mostly accomplished our goals, though we significantly scaled back our goals for scientific research at mid-year.</li>
	<li>Our team has roughly doubled in size compared to a year ago. We&rsquo;re now in a much better position to recommend a significant amount of grantmaking. We also feel much better positioned to identify outstanding causes.</li>
	<li>This year, we have a general goal of focusing on making grants in the most outstanding causes we&rsquo;ve found. This is a departure from past years&rsquo; goals, which revolved around building knowledge and staff capacity. We expect to prioritize building knowledge and staff capacity again in the future, but we think this is a good year to focus on increasing our grantmaking. We currently are bottlenecked in terms of management capacity, and we believe that focusing on grantmaking will likely lead to a lot of learning that will inform future hiring and capacity building.</li>
	<li>Potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence will be a major priority for 2016. Not only will Daniel Dewey be working on this cause full-time, but Nick Beckstead and I will both be putting significant time into it as well. Some other staff will be contributing smaller amounts of time as appropriate.</li>
	<li>Other major focus areas where we expect significant grantmaking include criminal justice reform, farm animal welfare, and biosecurity. We expect to recommend at least $10 million in grants in each of these areas.</li>
	<li>We have a variety of other goals, including completing the separation of the Open Philanthropy Project as an independent organization from GiveWell, with its own employees and financials, though some individuals will continue to do work for both organizations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Progress in 2015</h2>

<p>In 2015, our goals were set out in several posts, and we set 6- rather than 12-month goals (with an update about 6 months in). Below is a summary, based on four posts.{footnote_1}<fn> </fn> Footnotes provide quotes from these posts supporting the summary.</p>

<p><strong>US policy: </strong>Our top priority was hiring and, later, onboarding full-time staff. We surpassed our 6-month goal (making two hires rather than the one we had aimed for), and then focused on working with the hires - <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/chloe-cockburn"">Chloe Cockburn</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/lewis-bollard"">Lewis Bollard</a> - to get in sync about goals and plans. A secondary priority was to explore giving opportunities in <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/labor-mobility"">immigration policy</a>, <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/land-use-reform"">land use reform</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/macroeconomic-policy"">macroeconomic stabilization policy</a>.{footnote_2}<fn> </fn></p>

<p>While we ended up making a small number of <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/grants?field_focus_area_target_id_selective=90"">immigration policy grants</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/grants?field_focus_area_target_id_selective=92"">land use reform grants</a>, we chose to focus more on <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/macroeconomic-policy"">macroeconomic stabilization policy</a> because we saw a clear set of funding opportunities that seemed timely and high-potential. (Investigations for these are still ongoing.)</p>

<p><strong>Global catastrophic risks:</strong> One of our top goals throughout the year was to make a full-time hire for working on <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/biosecurity"">biosecurity</a>. We recently had an offer accepted for the biosecurity role, which concludes that several-months-long search.</p>

<p>The other top goal evolved. Initially, we planned to explore giving opportunities in several other areas. We then put significant time into a <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/future-life-institute-artificial-intelligence-risk-reduction"">$1.2 million grant</a> in the cause of <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence"">potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence</a>. We came to believe this cause could be suitable for a full-time hire, and began working on a trial basis with <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/daniel-dewey"">Daniel Dewey</a> to explore it further.<fn>{footnote_3}</fn></p>

<p>Since then, we completed a basic landscape of this cause (forthcoming) and hired Daniel as a full-time employee to focus on it.</p>

<p><strong>Scientific research:</strong> We initially hoped to form clear priorities within scientific research funding by the end of 2015, comparable to where we then stood on U.S. policy and global catastrophic risks, though we recognized this was a stretch goal. By mid-year, it had become clear that we needed more scientific advisory capacity than we had. We wrote that we did not expect to accomplish this goal and shifted our focus to building advisory capacity. We also began preliminary exploration of possibilities in the social sciences.{footnote_4}</p>

<p>Since then, we have made substantial progress in scientific advisory hiring: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielmartinalarcon"">Daniel Martin-Alarcon</a> will be joining us in June as a full-time Scientific Advisor, and <a href=""http://plantandmicrobiology.berkeley.edu/profile/csomerville"">Chris Somerville</a>, who is currently working with us part-time, is planning to join us later in the year (after he finishes some other projects) as a full-time Senior Scientific Advisor. We have an offer out that, if accepted, would result in a third full-time scientific advisory hire.</p>

<p>We have made partial progress on a number of investigations of <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/investigating-neglected-goals-in-scientific-research"">neglected goals</a>, including malaria, tuberculosis, life extension, finding new uses for off-patent drugs, and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/animal-product-alternatives"">animal product alternatives</a>. Only the last of these has progressed to a public writeup, and much of this work was done as trial assignments with potential advisors (not all of whom ended up working with us long-term), so some of these investigations could still be a long way from public writeups.</p>

<p><strong>Other:</strong> We aimed to create an Open Philanthropy Project website and transfer our content from the GiveWell website to it. We also fell behind on putting out public content, and hoped to improve our processes around this.{footnote_5}</p>

<p>Since then, we launched the website and substantially improved our processes around writeups. There are still some cause investigations that we never finished or published, but we are now fairly consistently publishing grant writeups a few months after recommending grants. Another notable event of 2015 was our <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/co-funding-partnership-with-kaitlyn-trigger-and-mike-krieger"">partnership with Kaitlyn and Mike Krieger</a>.</p>

<h2>Takeaways from 2015</h2>

<p><strong>We&#39;ve expanded the team significantly and plan to slow the pace of hiring at this point.</strong> At the beginning of the year, the people spending significant (&gt;50%) time on the Open Philanthropy Project were:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Alexander Berger and Howie Lempel, who were primarily focused on hiring and/or cause selection, and recommended a limited number of grants.</li>
	<li>David Roodman, who focused on in-depth literature reviews that aided our cause selection.</li>
	<li>Nick Beckstead, whom we had just hired and begun onboarding.</li>
	<li>Cari Tuna and myself, focused on cause selection and oversight.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since then, the team has roughly doubled in size. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We&#39;ve brought on three cause-specific Program Officers: Chloe Cockburn (criminal justice reform), Lewis Bollard (farm animal welfare), and Daniel Dewey (potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence). A fourth cause-specific Program Officer will be starting soon to work on biosecurity.</li>
	<li>We&#39;ve improved our processes and significantly increased our capacity for <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/our-grantmaking-so-far-approach-and-process"">recommending grants and producing grant writeups</a>. Helen Toner and Nicole Ross lead this work.</li>
	<li>Nick Beckstead (new at the beginning of 2015) and Luke Muehlhauser (hired during 2015) now work on a variety of things, including helping with cause selection for life sciences (Nick) and social sciences (Luke).</li>
	<li>With two offers accepted and a third outstanding, we expect to have significant scientific advisory capacity by the end of 2016.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hiring was our main priority on nearly every front in 2015, and this growth in capacity was our main output for the year.</p>

<p>We&#39;re now in much better position to do a significant amount of grantmaking. For 2016, we plan to focus significantly more on grantmaking, because:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We haven&#39;t focused intensively on grantmaking before. Doing so now is likely to lead to a lot of learning that will inform future hiring and capacity building.</li>
	<li>Many of our teammates are still relatively new. In general, we expect to work intensively with new staff, and see them gradually take on more autonomy, freeing up managers&rsquo; capacity for further hiring and onboarding. Our management capacity is constrained now, and it would be difficult to do more hiring, but I expect this to change in the future.</li>
	<li>As discussed immediately below, we see some compelling philanthropic opportunities that we&#39;d like to pursue as quickly as we can.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We now feel that we have reasonably good context for identifying the causes that best fit our criteria.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>We&#39;ve put serious thought and discussion into all four of the <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus"">major categories</a> of potential focus areas that we&#39;ve identified as potential priorities. <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy"">US policy</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks"">global catastrophic risks</a> are categories that we&#39;ve investigated to the point of picking initial focus areas and starting to make grants. We&#39;ve looked into several causes in the life sciences (and to a lesser extent in the social sciences) and had many discussions with scientific advisors about which ones seem most promising. And through our experience with <a href=""http://www.givewell.org"">GiveWell</a> and discussions with the <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/miscellaneous/center-global-development-general-support-2016"">Center for Global Development</a>, we have at least a preliminary sense of what focus areas we might find promising within <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-health-and-development"">global health and development</a>.</li>
	<li>We&#39;ve also been putting more effort into the kinds of cost-effectiveness calculations that can start to give us an idea of how to compare opportunities <em>across</em> causes. We&#39;ve done very rough estimates of the good accomplished per dollar for grants where this seemed worth doing; see examples from <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/criminal-justice-reform/justleadershipusa-close-rikers-campaign#Direct_impact"">criminal justice reform</a>, <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/farm-animal-welfare/humane-league-corporate-cage-free-campaigns#Effectiveness_of_corporate_campaigns"">farm animal welfare</a>, and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/miscellaneous/center-global-development-general-support-2016#Our_conclusions_"">global development policy</a>. We&#39;ve also started thinking about how to compare these opportunities to <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities"">GiveWell&rsquo;s top charities</a>, and about the more general issue of what the <em>threshold</em> should be for &quot;good enough to fund now rather than saving the money for later&quot; (see <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/giving-now-vs-later"">this post</a>). We&#39;re still a long way away from having a systematic take on these issues, but we&#39;re starting to build our intuition about what sorts of giving opportunities are good, very good and outstanding by our criteria. We see some outstanding causes that we feel ready to work on now; we think doing so soon would be much better than doing so later, especially since we generally expect there to be more philanthropy following similar approaches to ours in the future (which would make our counterfactual impact smaller).</li>
</ul>

<p>With all of the above considerations in mind, we have a general goal this year of <strong>focusing on making grants in the most outstanding causes we&rsquo;ve found.</strong></p>

<p>This is a departure from past years&rsquo; goals, which revolved around building knowledge and staff capacity. It is also distinct from a goal we may have in the future: maximizing our &ldquo;money moved&rdquo; by, for instance, looking for giving opportunities where we could recommend a large amount of grantmaking while spending relatively little time. By contrast, focusing on the most outstanding causes we&rsquo;ve found could involve spending significant time per dollar of grantmaking and recommending a limited amount of grantmaking overall.</p>

<h2><a id=""Plans for 2016"" name=""Plans for 2016""></a>Plans for 2016</h2>

<p><strong>Potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence</strong> will be a major priority for 2016. Based on our investigations over the last few months, we believe that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>This cause stands out unusually strongly on our <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus"">criteria of importance, neglectedness and tractability</a>.</li>
	<li>Doing good work in this cause is likely to require a major time investment, beyond what we can expect from one cause-specific staffer alone. We aren&#39;t sure whether this will be true over the long run, but it seems likely to be true of our first year working intensively in this area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Accordingly, we are going to be investing significant capacity in this cause. Daniel Dewey will work on it full-time, and Nick Beckstead and I will both put significant time into it as well. Some other staff will be contributing smaller amounts of time as appropriate. Since Nick and I are both generalists, we expect this plan to have major opportunity costs: it will lower our overall capacity for cause selection and other cross-cutting work, such as refining our approach to cost-effectiveness estimates and improving our process for producing writeups. This is a tradeoff we&#39;re comfortable with for 2016, and we&rsquo;ll revisit the matter in about a year.</p>

<p>We won&#39;t necessarily recommend a large amount of grantmaking in this cause, though it&#39;s possible that we will. Our main goal is to lay the groundwork for more grantmaking in the future. We will elaborate more on the case that this cause presents an outstanding opportunity in future posts.</p>

<p><strong>Other global catastrophic risks.</strong> We hope to recommend at least $10 million worth of grants in the area of <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/biosecurity"">biosecurity</a> in the next year. A full-time Program Officer will be starting work in this area soon. We don&#39;t plan to prioritize other global catastrophic risks, though it&#39;s possible we will make some one-off grants (more on one-off grants below).</p>

<p><strong>U.S. policy.</strong> We hope to recommend at least $10 million worth of grants in <em>each</em> of <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/criminal-justice-reform"">criminal justice reform</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/farm-animal-welfare"">farm animal welfare</a>. We have cause-specific staffers leading our work in both areas. (In each case, we&#39;d include grants already made in these areas - since late 2015, when both staffers joined - as part of the $10 million.)</p>

<p>Alexander Berger&#39;s top priority continues to be supporting Chloe and Lewis&#39; work (on criminal justice reform and farm animal welfare, respectively). We&#39;re less set on what his other priorities will be, but with his remaining time, he is likely to work on some combination of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>exploring funding opportunities around a cluster of science and technology policy issues, such as policy around emerging technologies (potentially including advanced artificial intelligence) and other topics related to <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/science-policy-and-infrastructure"">science policy and infrastructure</a>.</li>
	<li>investigating a set of funding opportunities in <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/macroeconomic-policy"">macroeconomic stabilization policy</a>.</li>
	<li>maintaining or expanding upon our grants in <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy"">immigration policy</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/land-use-reform"">land use reform</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d guess that his work (aside from supporting Chloe and Lewis) will result in about $10 million worth of grant recommendations in 2016, but with high uncertainty.</p>

<p><strong>Scientific research.</strong> We still have a substantial amount of work to do before we&#39;ll be ready to set focus areas within scientific research. We don&#39;t plan to set a particular goal for 2016, because (a) we are allocating senior generalist time to potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence; and (b) we think time spent on scientific research will be much more productive after our scientific advisors come on board.</p>

<p><strong>Effective altruism.</strong> There is a strong possibility that we will make grants aimed at helping grow the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism"">effective altruist</a> community in 2016. Nick Beckstead, who has strong connections and context in this community, would lead this work. This would be a change from our <a href=""http://effective-altruism.com/ea/pf/why_the_open_philanthropy_project_isnt_currently/"">previous position on effective altruism funding</a>, and a future post will lay out what has changed.</p>

<p><strong>Other grants.</strong> As discussed above, we have significantly better capacity - and context - for evaluating potential grants than we&rsquo;ve had in the past. As such, we are making a moderate effort to identify potential grants that <em>don&#39;t</em> fit neatly into an existing focus area, but that are highly &quot;shovel-ready&quot; (in the sense that we can identify a specific potential grantee) and appear strong overall based on the knowledge we&#39;ve picked up in the course of our many cause investigations and discussions. We don&#39;t expect to make a large number of these grants, but we expect to make some.</p>

<p><strong>Other goals.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>We hope that by the end of 2016, the Open Philanthropy Project will operate as an independent organization from GiveWell, with its own employees and financials, though some individuals will continue to do work for both organizations.</li>
	<li>We continue to commission case studies on philanthropy&rsquo;s past successes as part of our <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/history-of-philanthropy"">history of philanthropy work</a>. We also continue to collect relevant cases informally. By the end of 2016, we hope to publish a summary of what we&rsquo;ve learned about the history of philanthropy, which will be a significant update from our <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/philanthropys-success-stories"">2012 post on the subject</a>.</li>
	<li>We hope to continue improving cross-cutting aspects of how we work. Our interests include improving our process for producing public writeups, refining our approach to cost-effectiveness estimates and comparing the good accomplished by different grants, refining our thinking about <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/giving-now-vs-later"">how much giving we should recommend to GiveWell&#39;s top charities</a>, and finding ways to improve our general forecasting abilities (since our grantmaking decisions rely on views about what developments are likely in the future). We expect to do some work on all of these fronts, but it will not be a major priority with a concrete goal this year.</li>
	<li>We still don&#39;t have the capacity we&#39;d need to identify focus areas within the category of <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-health-and-development"">global health and development</a> - beyond our existing connection to <a href=""http://www.givewell.org"">GiveWell</a>&#39;s work and our support of the <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/miscellaneous/center-global-development-general-support-2016"">Center for Global Development</a>. We don&rsquo;t plan to build this capacity in 2016 and expect to revisit this in a future year.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Our new goal is to be in the late stages of making at least one &ldquo;big bet&rdquo; - a major grant ($5+ million) or full-time hire - in the next six months ... Our highest priority is to make a full-time hire on <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/criminal-justice-reform"">criminal justice reform</a>, <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/treatment-animals-industrial-agriculture"">factory farming</a> (pending a last bit of cause investigation, focused on the prospects for research on meat alternatives), or <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/macroeconomic-policy"">macroeconomic policy</a>. Our second-highest priority is to further explore <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/labor-mobility"">international labor mobility</a> and land use reform, with an eye to either finding more giving opportunities (hopefully including at least one major one) or to developing a full-time job description.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/open-philanthropy-project-update"">September update</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the next six months, our top priority will be working with Chloe and Lewis to get in sync about goals and plans for those fields. Over time, we hope that the new program officers will lead this work with less involvement from us, but we believe it is important to invest early on in understanding each other&#39;s thinking.</p>

<p>We expect that Alexander Berger, who leads our work on U.S. policy, will also have substantial time to pursue giving opportunities in causes that we aren&#39;t currently expecting to make full-time hires for - particularly <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/labor-mobility"">immigration policy</a> and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/land-use-reform"">land use reform</a>.</p>

<p>We expect to continue working on <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/macroeconomic-policy"">macroeconomic stabilization policy</a> in some way, but we aren&#39;t yet sure whether we will make a full-time hire for this cause. If we do not, it will be one of Alexander&#39;s top priorities along with the two causes in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>As a much lower priority, we will continue to conduct investigations on other causes.</p>
</blockquote>
|<p><a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/open-philanthropy-project-update-global-catastrophic-risks"">March update on global catastrophic risks</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our new goal is to be in the late stages of making at least one &#39;big bet&#39; - a major grant ($5+ million) or full-time hire - in the next six months. We think there is a moderate likelihood that we will hit this goal; if we do not, we will narrow our focus to a smaller number of causes in order to raise our odds.</p>

<p>Our highest priority is to make a full-time hire for working on <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/biosecurity"">biosecurity</a>. As a second priority, we are spending significant time on various aspects of <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/geoengineering"">geoengineering</a>, <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/geomagnetic-storms"">geomagnetic storms</a>, risks from artificial intelligence, and some issues that cut across different global catastrophic risks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/open-philanthropy-project-update"">September update</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We decided to prioritize investigating the possibility of helping to support the Future of Life Institute research grants program. We ended up spending a large amount of time investigating this opportunity. It was difficult to tell in advance what the size of our recommendation (if any) would be; we ended up recommending a grant of ~$1.2 million. In some sense, this grant was a &#39;big bet&#39; given that we saw it as a major opportunity and invested significant time in it, although the grant size we ended up with was below the working definition of a &#39;big bet&#39; above ...</p>

<p>We now have the impression that the field of research on potential risks of advanced artificial intelligence is changing rapidly - in particular, the amount of interest and the number of projects are growing - and if we do prioritize this area it may call for a full-time specialist. (This is a change from our previous position, where we saw the space as quite thin and unlikely to be a fit for a full-time position). Accordingly, we have begun working with a contractor (who could become a Program Officer in the future) to do a more in-depth investigation of the different possible activities in this space ...</p>

<p>Over the next six months, our top priorities will be <a href=""http://files.givewell.org/files/open-philanthropy-project/jobs/Open_Philanthropy_Project_Biosecurity_and_Pandemic_Preparedness_Senior_Program_Officer_Job_Posting.pdf"">our search for a full-time biosecurity hire</a> and the above-mentioned work on investigating the field around potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence.</p>

	<li>We have started an exploration of social sciences research.

<blockquote>
<p>We have recently been prioritizing investigation over public writeups, and our public content is running well behind our private investigations. We are experimenting with different processes for writing up completed investigations - in particular, trying to assign more of the work to more junior staff. If we could do this, it would make a major difference to our capacity, since senior staff already have a substantial challenge keeping up with all of our priority causes. By the end of 2015, we hope that our public content will be no further behind our private investigations than it is at the moment.</p>

<p>In 2014, we created the &#39;Open Philanthropy Project&#39; name - replacing <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/open-philanthropy-project-formerly-givewell-labs"">GiveWell Labs</a> - and created a preliminary website. In the coming year, we plan to launch a more substantial website for the Open Philanthropy Project, and to look further into the idea of creating a separate organization (which we see as highly likely to happen in the long run).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/open-philanthropy-project-update"">September update</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are hoping to launch a website for the Open Philanthropy Project by the end of the year. We believe that the new website will make it much easier to understand our work and current priorities. Creating it has been a significant amount of work, and it remains difficult to forecast exactly when the website will be ready to launch.</p>

<p>We&#39;re still not where we want to be on public content: we have many writeups still in progress, and our content is not well-organized (largely because it is on the GiveWell website rather than a separate Open Philanthropy Project website). By the end of the year, we hope that the situation will be much better due to launching our new website and publishing most of our still-pending writeups, but we expect that we will still have significant progress to make at that time.</p>

"544","Our Grants to GiveWell’s 2015 Recommended Charities","<p>We are excited to announce our grants to <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities"">GiveWell&rsquo;s &ldquo;top charities&rdquo; for the 2015 giving season</a>: the Against Malaria Foundation, the Deworm the World Initiative, GiveDirectly, and the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative.</p>

<p>These charities deliver cost-effective, evidence-backed and scalable interventions, and we think they represent some of the best giving opportunities in the world.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re actively looking for longer-term, higher-risk/reward giving opportunities through our work on the <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org"">Open Philanthropy Project</a>. In time, we hope to find even better bets than GiveWell&rsquo;s top charities for improving others&rsquo; lives.</p>

<p>But we don&rsquo;t take it for granted that better bets exist.{footnote_1} And while we look for them, <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/giving-now-vs-later"">we want to do as much good as we can with the information we have</a>. We believe the good we do by giving today will compound over time, by helping to put extremely low-income people in a better position to help themselves, their families, and their communities in the future.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re also proud to support outstanding organizations that serve as a model for how to serve others effectively and transparently.</p>

<p>This year, we asked GiveWell make a recommendation to us regarding how much to grant to each of its top charities. We&rsquo;ve decided to follow GiveWell&rsquo;s recommendation and make the following grants:</p>

<ul>
	<li>$22.8 million to the Against Malaria Foundation, which funds the distribution of bed nets for the prevention of malaria;</li>
	<li>$10.8 million to Evidence Action&rsquo;s Deworm the World Initiative, which supports government programs that provide deworming treatments to school-aged children and other people at risk;</li>
	<li>$9.8 million to GiveDirectly, which makes direct cash transfers to extremely low-income households;</li>
	<li>$1 million to the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, which also supports government programs that provide deworming treatments to school-aged children and other people at risk;</li>
	<li>$250,000 to each of GiveWell&rsquo;s &ldquo;standout charities&rdquo;: Development Media International, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition&rsquo;s Universal Salt Iodization program, the Iodine Global Network, and Living Goods.</li>
</ul>

<p>We&rsquo;re deeply grateful for the work of these outstanding organizations and to everyone on the GiveWell team for the many, many hours they put into researching and refining their recommendations to us and other donors.

"534","Why a New Study of the Mariel Boatlift Has Not Changed Our Views on the Benefits of Immigration","<p>As&nbsp;a consultant for the Open Philanthropy Project last year, I <a href=""http://davidroodman.com/blog/2014/09/03/the-domestic-economic-impacts-of-immigration/"">reviewed</a> the research on whether immigration reduces employment or earnings&nbsp;for workers in receiving countries. I concluded that for&nbsp;natives&nbsp;the harm, if any, is small.</p>

<p>Last month the&nbsp;prominent immigration researcher <a href=""http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/gborjas/"">George Borjas</a>&nbsp;posted&nbsp;a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20151007165844/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/gborjas/publications/working%20papers/Mariel2015.pdf"">challenge</a>&nbsp;to a&nbsp;seminal study in my review. His new paper&nbsp;contends that the Mariel boatlift, which brought&nbsp;some 60,000&nbsp;Cuban refugees to&nbsp;Miami in 1980, <em>did</em> profoundly affect the labor market there, depressing wages for low-education men&nbsp;(ones with&nbsp;less than a high school education)&nbsp;by 10-30%.</p>

<p>Borjas&#39;s work is especially significant because it seems&nbsp;to upend&nbsp;a <a href=""http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf"">study of the boatlift</a>&nbsp;published&nbsp;by <a href=""https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/faculty/808"">David Card</a>&nbsp;25 years ago, which found little impact of all that immigration on workers in Miami. Interestingly, Borjas, who emphasizes the harm of Cuban immigration, is himself a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_J._Borjas#Personal_life_and_education"">Cuban emigr&eacute;</a>.</p>

<p>I probed this dispute, replicating and checking the results in the dueling papers. I&nbsp;ultimately found little cause&nbsp;to change my views.&nbsp;The main reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Of the two Census Bureau data sets that Borjas relies on, the one with&nbsp;larger samples shows smaller impacts.</li>
	<li>According to that data set, wages for women, which&nbsp;Borjas excludes,&nbsp;<em>rose</em>, if anything,&nbsp;after immigration spikes (especially after a second one in 1994&ndash;95).</li>
	<li>I see no&nbsp;sharp breaks from&nbsp;long-term trends of the sort that could be confidently&nbsp;attributed to the 1980&nbsp;immigration surge. The Borjas analysis appears correct that&nbsp;wages for low-education Miami men (defined henceforth as those with less than a high school education) were lower on average in 1981-83 than in 1977-79 &ndash; with the drop being larger than in most other US cities. But the data argue more for&nbsp;a steady long-term decline than&nbsp;sudden drops after immigration surges. The Borjas analysis tends to obscure this distinction by aggregating or smoothing data over several years.</li>
	<li>The original study by David Card is one of 17 covered in&nbsp;my review, including three&nbsp;others exploiting&nbsp;natural experiments in mass migration. None of the studies is as compelling as a randomized trial, but the overall picture &ndash; of at most modest harm from substantial immigration &ndash; does not change if the Card study is removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Details&nbsp;follow. <!--more--></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In my <a href=""http://davidroodman.com/blog/2014/09/03/the-domestic-economic-impacts-of-immigration"">evidence review</a>&nbsp;on the impacts of immigration in receiving countries, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>There is almost no evidence of anything close to one-to-one crowding out by new immigrant arrivals to the job market in industrial countries. Most studies find that 10 percentage point increase in the immigrant &ldquo;stock&rdquo; as a share of the labor force changes natives&rsquo; earnings by between &ndash;2% and +2% (Longhi, Nijkamp, and Poot 2005, Fig 1; Peri 2014, Pg 1). Although serious questions can be raised about the reliability of most studies, the scarcity of evidence for great pessimism stands as a fact. The economies of destination countries largely appear flexible enough to absorb new arrivals, especially given time.</blockquote>

<p>I&nbsp;based that&nbsp;conclusion in substantial part on&nbsp;studies that exploit natural experiments, large and sudden movements of people that have the best hope of&nbsp;making&nbsp;major side-effects of immigration obvious. It was David Card who inaugurated this literature&nbsp;with his 1990 paper on&nbsp;the Mariel boatlift. I tersely summarized that paper&nbsp;this way in a <a href=""http://davidroodman.com/blog/2014/09/03/the-domestic-economic-impacts-of-immigration#Tab2"">table at the end of my review</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Natural experiment not as perfect as randomized since other events could have offset Boatlift&rsquo;s effects. But zero change after 7% labor supply spike most easily explained as (non-)impact.</blockquote>

<p>(Earlier on, my review also discusses the paper more fully.)</p>

<p>The great boatlift began in April 1980 when Fidel Castro opened the Cuban port of Mariel for exit. Americans, presumably including many Cuban-Americans, provided the boats. Wikipedia<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariel_boatlift"">&nbsp;helpfully reviews</a>&nbsp;the local&nbsp;and global&nbsp;events leading to this unusual episode. The major pulse of people came in May and June, and the flow was halted&nbsp;in September. Some 125,000 Cubans came to the US, half settling in Miami (Card, p. 246).</p>

<p>In addition, as Borjas documents, a&nbsp;second wave of Cuban immigration, about half as large, arrived in 1994-95 (Borjas, Figure 1).{footnote_1}</p>

<p>Card&#39;s&nbsp;1990 study analyzes the data two ways, somewhat informally. The first looks at differences over time &ndash; at whether wages, employment, and unemployment rose or fell&nbsp;for various demographic groups in Miami over 1979-85.{footnote_2} The second looks at differences-in-differences. In particular, Card constructs a comparison&nbsp;group of four cities and looks not at whether Miami&#39;s wages, employment, and unemployment rose or fell but at whether they did so more than in the comparison&nbsp;group. This strategy&nbsp;controls for national factors such as economic recession to the extent they affected Miami and the comparison group equally. The comparison&nbsp;cities are Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, and Tampa-St. Petersburg. The algorithm for forming&nbsp;the control group was informal:</p>

<blockquote>These four cities&nbsp;were selected both because they had&nbsp;relatively large populations of blacks and&nbsp;Hispanics and because they exhibited a&nbsp;pattern of economic growth similar to that&nbsp;in Miami over the late 1970s and early&nbsp;1980s. (Card, p. 249)</blockquote>

<p>Card generally does not find that things worsened for workers in Miami after 1980, at least not more so than in the comparisons&nbsp;cities. The many specific checks do include exceptions. For example, among blacks&nbsp;in Miami, unemployment jumped from 5.6% to 9.6% between 1980 and 1981, a statistically significant increase, while it held steady at 12.6% in the control group (Card, Table 4, rows 2 &amp; 6). Narrowing to low-education blacks, unemployment did not rise in Miami relative to the control cities until 1982, which Card (p. 253) views as too late for&nbsp;confident attribution to the 1980 boatlift.</p>

<p>My <a href=""http://davidroodman.com/david/Roodman%20Borjas-Card%20replication.zip"">data and code</a> replicate the Card numbers quite well &ndash; some perfectly, the rest&nbsp;close&nbsp;enough to still support Card&#39;s inferences.</p>

<p>Borjas&#39;s retort a quarter century later draws on&nbsp;the same underlying data. But it differs in many respects. It limits the sample to ages 25-59 instead of 16-61, excludes women and Hispanics, favors&nbsp;different cities for the control group, focuses more on&nbsp;low-education workers, and differs in other minor ways.</p>

<p>The study&#39;s conclusion diverges&nbsp;too:</p>

<blockquote>The drop in the relative wage of the least educated Miamians was substantial (10 to 30 percent). (Borjas, p. 1)</blockquote>

<p>And Borjas is laudably transparent: you can <a href=""http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/gborjas/publications/journal/JEL2015Archive.zip"">download the Stata code</a> for most of his results from his website. (Underlying data are from <a href=""https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/group"">IPUMS CPS</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""http://www.nber.org/cps/"">NBER</a>. My own <a href=""http://davidroodman.com/david/Roodman%20Borjas-Card%20replication.zip"">data and code package</a>&nbsp;also contains files&nbsp;needed to reproduce much&nbsp;of the Borjas analysis.)</p>

<p>At first, I found the Borjas conclusion quite striking: in this extreme case of immigrant influx, it seemed that vulnerable people &ndash; those with little education &ndash; actually had suffered, and that this had been overlooked in Card&#39;s analysis. But as I probed more, I became less convinced.</p>

<p>To explain my thinking, I&#39;ll touch on&nbsp;some key differences between the two studies, then show you some graphs of annual&nbsp;data.</p>

<h2>Two data sources</h2>

<p>To my knowledge, the US Census Bureau conducts two surveys that gather national information on people&#39;s work and earnings. Both are part of the Current Population Survey (CPS) family, which originated in efforts during the Great Depression to get a firmer fix on how many people were employed and how much they were making.</p>

<p>According to this <a href=""http://www.nber.org/data/morg.html"">FAQ page</a>, the CPS interviews 50-60,000 households&nbsp;every month. Once a household enters the survey sample, it is interviewed once a month for four months, then left alone for eight months, then interviewed again, in the same four calendar months as before. The last of each quartet of interviews includes questions about how much household members&nbsp;worked and earned in the previous&nbsp;week. Since this information comes from people on their way out of a survey cycle, it is referred to as &quot;Outgoing Rotation Group&quot; data.&nbsp;ORG&nbsp;data undergird&nbsp;the government&#39;s monthly announcements of job growth and unemployment rates.</p>

<p>The other&nbsp;survey is the <a href=""https://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/data/model/info/cpsasec.html"">Annual&nbsp;Social and Economic Supplement</a>, which is folded into the CPS each March and asks people how much they earned&nbsp;<em>last year</em>. At least in Miami during the years of greatest interest here, this survey&nbsp;reached about half as many people.</p>

<p>Where Card uses ORG data, Borjas works with both data sets, in parallel. Borjas also narrows his sample more than Card, as noted above. This table counts <strong>Miamians in the two Census Bureau data sets in the&nbsp;core Borjas analysis and the most comparable Card analysis</strong>:</p>

<p>{image_1}</p>

<p>Because of the larger&nbsp;samples, analysis based on&nbsp;the ORG data seems more reliable. In addition, the ORG survey records recollections of earnings last week rather than last year, which may be more accurate; on the other hand, weekly data&nbsp;can&nbsp;be noisier since some people&#39;s earnings vary substantially week-to-week. Notably, the&nbsp;more dramatic results in the Borjas paper come from the smaller ASEC samples.</p>

<h2>Whether to include women</h2>

<p>Card includes women in his analysis. Borjas does not. Among the many differences between the two, this one matters. Borjas explains his focus this way:</p>

<blockquote>It is tempting to increase sample size by including working women, but female labor force participation was increasing very rapidly in the 1980s, so that wage trends are likely to be affected by the selection that obviously marks women&rsquo;s entry into the labor market.</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure what this means. The idea seems to be that forces unrelated to the&nbsp;Cuban influx&nbsp;were driving trends in women&#39;s earnings, and these could mask the effect of that influx. [<em>Update, October 21: an email from Borjas appears to confirm this reading.</em>] But similar things might be said for low-education men, whose earnings&nbsp;would&nbsp;have been influenced by broad events&nbsp;such as recessions and de-industrialization. Analytical&nbsp;devices&nbsp;such benchmarking against control groups and focussing on&nbsp;changes&nbsp;<em>immediately&nbsp;</em>after the immigration influx should seemingly work as well for women as for men.</p>

<p>If Borjas excludes women precisely because he knows in advance that their wage trend contradicts&nbsp;the pattern he is looking for, who is engaging in biased selection?</p>

<p>So it seems to me that Borjas&#39;s methods will work as well or poorly for both genders, and that both merit attention.</p>

<h2>Sudden or gradual changes?</h2>

<p>A third differences is that while Card reports annual figures, Borjas groups data into longer periods, in various ways. His graphs show three-year moving averages. Some regressions (Borjas, Tables 5 &amp; 6) compare 1977-79 to 1981-83 and subsequent three-year periods. Others combine 1981-86 into a single &quot;short-run&quot; post-boatlift period.</p>

<p>Combining multiple years of data makes it hard to discern if wages for low-education people dropped suddenly right after&nbsp;the boatlift, or not until a couple of years later, or merely continued a gradual decline.</p>

<p>Put otherwise, Borjas appears readier than Card&nbsp;(or me)&nbsp;to attribute changes 3-5 years after the boatlift to the boatlift. I am unready&nbsp;because many forces buffeted the Miami economy circa 1980 &ndash; an oil shock, extreme interest rates, two recessions, and a debt crisis in Latin America. To be fair, they affected cities in the control group too, but perhaps not equally. A relative wage drop 3-5 years after the boatlift seems to admit many explanations.</p>

<h2>Fresh&nbsp;plots</h2>

<p>To pierce the confusion, I made some graphs. They are designed to closely parallel Borjas&#39;s statistical analysis &ndash; the&nbsp;samples, the control group, the control variables, the&nbsp;formulas for&nbsp;variables such as earnings &ndash; while breaking out the data by year.</p>

<p>The first one plots&nbsp;the evolution of&nbsp;inflation-adjusted earnings for the group in the crosshairs of&nbsp;Borjas&#39;s microscope: low-education, non-Hispanic,&nbsp;male Miami workers aged 25-59. The data come from the ASEC survey, which, recall, yields&nbsp;some&nbsp;20 data points a&nbsp;year circa 1980. (More explanation below the graph. Click or tap it&nbsp;for&nbsp;a larger version.)</p>

<p>{image_2}</p>

<p>In blue are average inflation-adjusted annual earnings for these Miami workers, expressed relative to the levels in the study&#39;s start year,&nbsp;1977.{footnote_3} So a value for some year of 75% means a 25% fall since the start. The smeared blue diamonds depict the 95% confidence ranges&nbsp;for&nbsp;these averages; this novel rendition&nbsp;is meant to remind you that probability is not spread&nbsp;uniformly within those ranges, but concentrated near their centers. (David Sparks <a href=""https://dsparks.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/choropleth-tutorial-and-regression-coefficient-plots"">invented</a>&nbsp;this rendition.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.soz.unibe.ch/content/ueber_uns/jann/index_ger.html"">Ben Jann</a>&nbsp;brings it to life with his awesome <a href=""https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457686.html"">coefplot</a>.)</p>

<p>The graph makes it look likely&nbsp;that earnings in&nbsp;this demographic fell between the late 1970s and the early 1980s.</p>

<p>In red, in the same graph, are average wages after adjusting&nbsp;for the evolving the age composition of the group&nbsp;and&nbsp;systematic differences in earnings growth or decline across cities, as well as&nbsp;benchmarking against a Borjas-favored&nbsp;comparison&nbsp;group (Anaheim, Rochester, Nassau-&shy;Suffolk, and San Jose).{footnote_4} All&nbsp;of these adjustments mimic the Borjas analysis. The&nbsp;cities in the Borjas comparison group look peculiar as a collective benchmark for Miami, but were chosen because they most nearly matched Miami&#39;s 1977-80 employment growth rate of 15.3% (Borjas, Table 3).</p>

<p>At any rate, these adjustments make little difference. The red diamonds &ndash; shifted right&nbsp;of the blue ones for legibility &ndash; also&nbsp;show a wage decline from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, with an especially big drop in 1982.</p>

<p>Last, the green diamonds&nbsp;show the result of grouping data into three year-periods, again in order to copy&nbsp;Borjas (Borjas, Table 5 &amp; 6). Comparing green dots, wages were clearly lower in 1981-83 than in 1977-79.</p>

<p>Borjas too makes graphs from ASEC&nbsp;data; they show&nbsp;earnings&nbsp;for low-education men in Miami <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20151007165844/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/gborjas/publications/working%20papers/Mariel2015.pdf#page=44"">nosediving in the&nbsp;1980s</a>. I see two problems with those graphs. First, as I mentioned, they plot&nbsp;three-year moving averages, which obscure the timing of the declines in a context where timing is of the essence. Second, unlike the graph&nbsp;above, Brojas&#39;s graphs&nbsp;include no confidence intervals, so they convey false certainty to the untrained eye.</p>

<p>My next graph switches to the more plentiful ORG data set and exploits its coverage to carry forward to 2001, the last year in the Borjas computer code.{footnote_5} A second vertical line is added for the 1994-95 migration surge:</p>

<p>{image_3}</p>

<p>The decline circa 1980 is still visible. But it looks a bit&nbsp;milder now. The trough in 1983 no longer approaches the&nbsp;50%-drop line.&nbsp;And this flattening parallels Borjas&#39;s statistical results, which are milder for ORG data (Borjas, Table 5, row 1, vs. Table 6, row 1).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Borjas&#39;s finding of a wage decline after the 1980 boatlift still looks&nbsp;reasonable, if read literally.</p>

<p>But I find it hard, viewing these graphs, to confidently attribute that fall to some&nbsp;shock in 1980.&nbsp;The decline appears gradual and long-term. Neither graph displays&nbsp;a sharp, statistically significant drop&nbsp;immediately after the boatlift.</p>

<p>And switching to women reveals an&nbsp;opposite pattern. Their earnings <em>rose</em> after immigration surges:&nbsp;</p>

<p>{image_4}</p>

<p>(In contrast, the <a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/learnwkeRealTCMeanASEC12.png"">corresponding graph</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;ASEC data still shows a&nbsp;slight, statistically insignificant&nbsp;drop among&nbsp;women in 1981.)</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, combining the falling men and rising women smooths things out:</p>

<p>{image_5}</p>

<p>(And here&#39;s the <a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/learnwkeRealTCMeanASEC31.png"">corresponding graph</a> from ASEC data.)</p>

<p>Notice that in 1977-82, the blue diamonds for average&nbsp;wages are statistically indistinguishable, as are the red ones for the adjusted means. It is only in 1983 that a larger drop&nbsp;emerges, and even it is transient, indistinguishable from noise. Meanwhile, wages rise, if anything, after the 1994-95 immigration surge.</p>

<p>I believe&nbsp;these graphs provide a clearer picture than the Borjas paper of the underlying data.&nbsp;They do not make a compelling case for harmful side effects of immigration.</p>

<p>Code and data replicating Borjas, Card, and my own analysis are&nbsp;<a href=""http://davidroodman.com/david/Roodman%20Borjas-Card%20replication.zip"">here</a>. Also&nbsp;included is a&nbsp;larger set of graphs generated by that code, covering hourly wages, employment, and unemployment.</p>

<p>All this graphical analysis is a bit loose, but the graphs come from formal&nbsp;regressions, numerical results from which are in <a href=""http://davidroodman.com/david/Borjas%20replication%20tables.pdf"">two tables</a>. These check whether annual and hourly wages and, in the ORG data, employment and unemployment changed significantly in Miami from 1980 to 1981, 1982, or 1983, as well as from 1977-79 to 1981-83. They show changes with little significance by 1981 but more significance by 1982.</p>

<p>Possibly the Mariel boatlift did swamp the Miami labor market, but with a two year delay. But these results are also consistent with the continuation of long-term trends in Miami. I see no strong basis for implicating immigration.</p>

<p>Perhaps I interpret the data differently because of a difference in priors. If I&nbsp;<em>assume</em> that immigration is a potentially leading&nbsp;force in labor markets, then I may be ready to blame the 1980 boatlift for the exceptional wage drop&nbsp;in Miami in&nbsp;the late 1980s, depicted above. But that comes close to assuming the conclusion. If I instead come to the data with more skepticism, mindful that many idiosyncratic forces impinge&nbsp;upon local labor markets, then graphs like that will not change my mind. Only a sharp drop soon after the boatlift would force me to reconsider.</p>

<p>In its favor, Borjas&#39;s work&nbsp;has accentuated my&nbsp;appreciation of the limitations of Card&#39;s study. Even when looking short-term, over a year or so after a major immigration flow, many factors many disturb labor markets enough to obscure the effects of immigration. There is a lot of noise in the data. The appearance of no real effect is not conclusive.</p>

<p>But&nbsp;my previous, terse summary still reads about right to me: &quot;Natural experiment not as perfect as randomized since other events could have offset Boatlift&rsquo;s effects. But zero change after 7% labor supply spike most easily explained as (non-)impact.&quot; More broadly, the overall impact of immigration on workers in the receiving country looks modestly negative at worst, with the most vulnerable group being <em>recent</em> immigrants. And there is little doubt that migrants from poor countries as a group <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150826064431/http://www.cgdev.org/files/1425376_file_Clemens_Economics_and_Emigration_FINAL.pdf"">gain immensely</a> by migrating.</p>

"520","Coming Down to Earth: What if a Big Geomagnetic Storm Does Hit?","<p><em>This is the fourth post in a <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/topic/Geomagnetic+Storms"">series</a> about geomagnetic storms as a <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/open-philanthropy-project-update-global-catastrophic-risks"">global catastrophic risk</a>. A paper covering the material in this series was <a href=""http://davidroodman.com/david/The%20risk%20of%20geomagnetic%20storms%205%20dr.pdf"">recently released</a>.</em></p>

<p>I devoted the <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/geomagnetic-storms-an-introduction-to-the-risk"">first</a> <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/geomagnetic-storms-historys-surprising-if-tentative-reassurance"">three</a> <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/geomagnetic-storms-using-extreme-value-theory-to-gauge-the-risk"">posts</a> in this series to describing&nbsp;geomagnetic storms and assessing the odds that a Big One is coming. I concluded that the iconic Carrington superstorm of 1859 was neither as intense nor as overdue&nbsp;for&nbsp;an encore as some prominent analysts have suggested. (I suppose that&#39;s unsurprising: those who say more-alarming things get more&nbsp;attention.) But my&nbsp;analysis is not certain. To paraphrase Churchill, the sun is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside a corona. And great harm would flow&nbsp;from what I cannot rule out: a blackout spanning states and lasting months.</p>

<p>I shift in this post from whether the Big One is coming to what will happen if it does. And here, unfortunately, my facility with statistics does less good, for the top questions are now about&nbsp;power engineering:&nbsp;how grids and high-voltage transformers respond to planetary magnetic concussions.</p>

<p>One reason for my incomplete understanding of power engineering is that the stuff is complicated. Another is the upshot of this post: I dug far enough to conclude&nbsp;that more research is needed. That phrase is a deadened cliche, but I mean it. We need to learn more! Considering the potential stakes, the effects of&nbsp;magnetic storms on&nbsp;grids are too poorly studied. Seven-figure expenditures on research&nbsp;might stave off 12-figure&nbsp;damages (as in trillions). For an employee of a philanthropy, that&#39;s a bottom line. And the&nbsp;practical conclusion being reached, and my time being tight, it seemed efficient to stop&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll explain that conclusion just below. But first I stress that <b>my view on the potential value of funding in this area is attributable only to me.</b>&nbsp;The Open Philanthropy Project will weigh this cause against other possible focus areas.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll&nbsp;touch on four lines of evidence:</p>

	<li>Statistical correlations between storm activity and transformer failures</li>
	<li>Field tests</li>

<p>Power lines and transformers are easier to fathom&nbsp;than the objects of the previous posts &ndash; sun spots the size of the earth and&nbsp;coronal clouds&nbsp;hurtling through space at 1% of the speed of light &ndash; but&nbsp;their behavior during storms is not necessarily better understood. One challenge for science is that to test a high-voltage transformer under realistic conditions, you need to channel enough power through it to serve a small city, and that&nbsp;is hard&nbsp;if you don&#39;t have a spare small city on hand. Another challenge is that transformers are diverse in design, materials, age, quality of manufacture, and operating conditions, all of which impedes generalization. And transformers&nbsp;are, rather literally, black boxes: it&#39;s hard to monitor what&#39;s happening inside of them. Still another obstacle&nbsp;is that utilities and transformer manufactures probably know more than they say about the nature and consequences of the geomagnetic currents flowing through their systems.</p>

<p>In what follows, I&#39;ll try to give a sense of what is known.</p>

<h2>Case studies of failed transformers</h2>

<p>The research literature contains scattered reports of failures of high-voltage transformers, in New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden, the UK, and the US, and among other countries.{footnote_1} It turns out that many&nbsp;of these cases&nbsp;violate&nbsp;an&nbsp;image central to&nbsp;the&nbsp;doomsday scenario: currents of once-a-century&nbsp;proportions spiralling into transformers&nbsp;and&nbsp;frying them within minutes.</p>

<p>The 1989 storm, for example, <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20111102163541/http:/www.nerc.com/files/1989-Quebec-Disturbance.pdf#page=7"">disabled two transformers in&nbsp;Qu&eacute;bec</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20111102163541/http:/www.nerc.com/files/1989-Quebec-Disturbance.pdf#page=16"">several at the Salem nuclear plant in New Jersey</a>. Yet the currents&nbsp;that undid&nbsp;the Qu&eacute;bec transformers were not generated by the storm but rather by hydroelectric dams to which the&nbsp;transformers&nbsp;were linked. As the Qu&eacute;bec grid went through a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20130616204545/http://www.solarstorms.org/SWChapter1.pdf#page=3"">disorderly, 72-second&nbsp;</a>collapse, these transformers&nbsp;were momentarily forced to receive energetic load from the dams while being cut off from the grid to which they normally conveyed the energy. The recorded cause of death was&nbsp;&quot;overvoltage.&quot; As no other transformers appear to have been disabled, these two&nbsp;were casualties of the grid&#39;s largely successful&nbsp;self-protective response.</p>

<p>In Salem, it&nbsp;appears that&nbsp;storm-driven currents indeed disabled the transformers there in the way envisaged in the doomsday scenario. Here are charred and broken&nbsp;coils&nbsp;found in&nbsp;one of them:</p>

<p>{image_1}</p>

<p>But the Salem plant&#39;s experience is nonrepresentative in that the&nbsp;plant&#39;s location put it at unusually high risk. Situated&nbsp;on an <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/search/salem+nuclear+plant/@39.4693814,-75.5318629,3349m/data=!3m1!1e3"">artificial island in the&nbsp;Delaware Bay</a>,&nbsp;the plant complex served as an attractive&nbsp;electrical bridge between the regional&nbsp;power network to the west and the conductive Atlantic Ocean to the east. And&nbsp;the igneous ground beneath the plant is electrically resistive, so it could not absorb any of the intense&nbsp;electrical pressure. So, on the one hand, the Salem plant transformers look to have been&nbsp;more vulnerable&nbsp;than most.&nbsp;On the other hand, their story illustrates&nbsp;the danger&nbsp;of ignoring geomagnetic storms when designing&nbsp;power systems.</p>

<p>At the Salem plant, interestingly, the transformers died less with with a bang than a whimper:&nbsp;<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20111102163541/http:/www.nerc.com/files/1989-Quebec-Disturbance.pdf#page=16"">10 days passed</a> from shock to shutdown. That delayed response&nbsp;resonates with reports <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20111016042440/http://www.labplan.ufsc.br/congressos/powertech07/papers/445.pdf"">by Trevor Gaunt and Gert Coetzee</a> from South Africa. The country that had been seen as too close to the equator to be vulnerable to geomagnetic storms. Yet there, after the Halloween 2003 geomagnetic storm, the condition of eight transformers steadily&nbsp;degraded.{footnote_2} High-voltage transformers are bathed in oil for cooling. When magnetic cores <em>saturate</em> and the field strays outside the core (see my <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/geomagnetic-storms-an-introduction-to-the-risk"">first post</a>), wires and insulation can overheat and in effect burn. Hot spots manifest not as a flames (one hopes) but as chemical decomposition that forces gaseous byproducts into the oil, which can be monitored. In all of these eight transformers, degradation began right after storm activity and proceeded slowly, so that failure arrived in weeks or months rather than minutes.&nbsp;This graph shows parts per million of dissolved gases in&nbsp;one of the ill-fated transformers, at the <a href=""http://carma.org/plant/detail/27542"">Matimba power plant</a>, over 12 months:</p>

<p>{image_2}</p>

<p>The gas concentrations&nbsp;began to creep upward after the Halloween storm. Perhaps during the storm, paper insulation around some of the wires was damaged, leading to short circuits and, in time, additional overheating. This suggests the existence of a perverse &ldquo;goldilocks&rdquo; magnitude for geomagnetically induced currents: weak enough not to trigger protective shutdowns, strong enough to disable a high-voltage transformer &ndash; in time.</p>

<p>The South Africa experience makes me wonder: perhaps&nbsp;the common focus on&nbsp;<em>extremes</em>&nbsp;(including in my own work) is&nbsp;partly misguided. Perhaps the greatest risk lies with&nbsp;once-a-decade rather than once-a-century&nbsp;storms, or with lower-latitude exposure to those most extreme storms.</p>

<h2>Statistical correlations between storm activity and transformer failures</h2>

<p>The second line of evidence on transformer vulnerability is statistical. These graphs from&nbsp;a <a href=""https://elibrary.ferc.gov/IDMWS/common/downloadOpen.asp?downloadfile=20140324%2D5083%2829221108%29%2Epdf&amp;folder=17453674&amp;fileid=13490190&amp;trial=1"">report by John Kappenman</a>&nbsp;show that&nbsp;after peaks in storm activity, notably in 1982 and 1989, high-voltage transformer failures in the US spiked. The upper graph shows readings on the&nbsp;<em>Ap</em> storm intensity index, which is similar to the <em>D<sub>st&nbsp;</sub></em>index in my <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/geomagnetic-storms-using-extreme-value-theory-to-gauge-the-risk"">last post</a>. The blue line in the lower graph shows the number of failures each&nbsp;year of the high-voltage transformers that are of greatest concern:</p>

<p>{image_3}</p>

<p>I have not managed to obtain the&nbsp;data for the lower graph, but the two graphs together&nbsp;make me reasonably&nbsp;confident that&nbsp;space weather is a&nbsp;major proximate cause of high-voltage transformer failure in the United States.</p>

<h2>Field tests</h2>

<p>Some engineers have experimentally run large currents through high-voltage transformers&nbsp;and measured the impacts. Typically these currents have been constant&nbsp;(direct current or DC, like what comes out of a battery or solar panel)&nbsp;rather than oscillating&nbsp;(like&nbsp;the&nbsp;alternating current or AC&nbsp;that&nbsp;is produced by most power plants and sent through most transformers). DC is an&nbsp;imperfect proxy for geomagnetically induced currents, which tend to vary more slowly than standard AC, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetically_induced_current#Risk_to_infrastructure"">but are hardly constant</a>.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, no doubt inspired by the great 1989 storm, engineers for Tokyo Electric Power, Toshiba, Hitachi, and Mitsubishi <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1109/61.296304"">ran heavy currents through scaled-down models of transformers</a>. The largest model was of the type that theory and smaller-scale tests indicated was most vulnerable. When receiving 200 amperes of current (some <a href=""https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071127204717AAa8WuU"">10,000 times what&#39;s needed</a> to arrest a human heart), this model&rsquo;s temperature rose 110 degrees Celsius over 20&ndash;30 minutes, then stabilized. &ldquo;The magnitude of this temperature rise corresponds to a fairly large [geomagnetically induced current] level, and since the frequency of occurrence of this level is low and the duration of the effect is short, the effects on transformers from the viewpoint of lifetime reduction are sufficiently small.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Finland, <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1109/61.997938"">Matti Lahtinen and Jarmo Elovaara</a>&nbsp;tested a new, full-scale model of transformer commissioned by the Finnish grid operator Finngrid. They too poured large direct&nbsp;currents into a transformer that was carrying no normal load. They too were reassured. &ldquo;The field tests&hellip;show that tested transformers may tolerate very high dc currents for times typical to geomagnetic storms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in Qu&eacute;bec, <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1109/61.568248"">four researchers</a>&nbsp;comparably tested two production transformers and found comparable reassurance.</p>

<p>This is all, well, reassuring. The major caveat is that we cannot be certain&nbsp;what would have happened under more realistic conditions: if the test current had been volatile as in a real storm, if the transformers had also been carrying normal power loads, and had been, say, 30 years old instead of&nbsp;new.</p>

<h2>Mathematical&nbsp;modeling</h2>

<p>Engineers&nbsp;have also built computer models to simulate what happens inside a big transformer when a geomagnetic storm sends electric current into it. Leading proponents of this approach are Ramsis Girgis and Kiran Vedante&nbsp;of&nbsp;ABB, a company that&nbsp;through mergers and acquisitions has retroactively become the maker&nbsp;of most high-voltage transformers in the US.</p>

<p>Girgis and Vedante&nbsp;<a href=""http://a2.cigre.org/content/download/33769/1473731/version/1/file/Effects+of+GIC+on+Power+Transformers+and+Power+Systems.pdf"">contend</a>&nbsp;that geomagnetically induced currents&nbsp;would do no disabling&nbsp;harm to the &ldquo;great majority&rdquo; of transformers. Why? Storms&nbsp;affect transformers in two main ways. The first is distortion in the currents going in and out. Normal currents are&nbsp;composed of smooth AC waves&nbsp;oscillating at&nbsp;50 or 60 times per second with fixed amplitude measured in volts. In a storm, the waveforms might gain noise, or wobble in frequency. The energy involved might not be overwhelming, but any such distortions can disrupt a&nbsp;finely tuned power system.&nbsp;Second,&nbsp;at particularly energetic moments,&nbsp;the storms can generate large current spikes that saturate the transformer&#39;s magnetic&nbsp;core and cause&nbsp;overheating. The second effect, argue the ABB engineers, takes places over minutes, perhaps even hours, while the first is nearly instantaneous &ndash; and should trip protective equipment that will disconnect&nbsp;the transformer before the second does serious&nbsp;harm. If a large storm &quot;trips&quot;&nbsp;many transformers, a blackout may ensue. But in that fragility lies resilience: after the storm passes, the grid can be switched back on.</p>

<p>Yes, concede Girgis and Vedante, some transformers have failed. But they were of obsolete&nbsp;designs, or poorly made. Of the Salem units, they write, &quot;These were old transformers that had an old winding lead design.&quot; The <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1109/TDC.2012.6281595"">South African transformers were</a> &quot;over-insulated which did not allow proper oil flow in these leads resulting in the overheating.&quot;</p>

<p>Girgis and Vedante may be right that transformer destruction&nbsp;will be the exception during major geomagnetic storms. I hope so. In their defense, they&#39;ve been right so far.</p>

<p>But should we rely upon the word of the ABB experts?&nbsp;Girgis and Vedante&#39;s<a href=""http://doi.org/10.1109/PESMG.2013.6672911"">&nbsp;published &quot;methodology&quot; paper</a>&nbsp;in fact provides almost no details on their methodology nor&nbsp;how it was validated&nbsp;against empirical data. Evidently the model is proprietary.&nbsp;In effect, the public&nbsp;is asked to trust the manufacturer&rsquo;s reassurances about the reliability of its products.&nbsp;I don&#39;t see a problem with that. Also, we should rely on&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/05/22/business/22reuters-gm-recall-justice.html"">GM&#39;s assurances about&nbsp;its&nbsp;ignition switches</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/business/international/takata-airbag-apology-issued-by-chief-executive.html"">Takata&#39;s about&nbsp;its airbags</a>...</p>

<p>Forgive the sarcasm. My purpose is not to impugn anyone&#39;s professionalism but to highlight the dangers of relying on manufacturers&#39; assurances when the stakes for human life are high. Confronting a risk this great with the seriousness it deserves&nbsp;calls for a more disinterested assessment.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>These four lines of evidence combine to produce a strange state of knowledge. Theory and field&nbsp;tests reassure. Statistical correlations and evidence from specific cases such as in South Africa suggest that not all is well.</p>

<p>I draw three&nbsp;conclusions &ndash; or infer three&nbsp;hypotheses for further exploration. First, modest&nbsp;magnetic tempests may do more harm over months than massive blasts do over minutes. (Of course, the modest tempests and massive blasts can be the same storms, experienced at different latitudes.) This hypothesis reconciles the year-to-year correlations between geomagnetic disturbances and transformer failures with the apparent loss of only a handful of transformers during the 1989 storm, the biggest of the postwar era.</p>

<p>This idea has complex implications for the effects of magnetic superstorms. A really big storm <em>might</em> cause hundreds of transformers to fail &ndash; perhaps over the following year, perhaps predominately at middle latitudes. The resulting exhaustion of spares and manufacturing capacity <em>could</em> be a slow-motion train wreck. Or perhaps, as may have already happened without anyone noticing, the degradation will be so gradual as to create no humanitarian risk.</p>

<p>Second, another way to reconcile the evidence at hand may be&nbsp;to factor in aging. The transformers simulated in models are ideals. The brand-new transformers put to field tests approximate the ideals as well as can be done in the real world. Perhaps as transformers wear out they become more vulnerable to storms.&nbsp;If a major storm administers the coup de gr&acirc;ce to many at once, one might&nbsp;argue that the storm is not the primary cause of their demise. But that would&nbsp;give&nbsp;little solace to people freezing in the dark. Or, in a subtle variation on this idea, perhaps old transformers are vulnerable&nbsp;by virtue of design rather than aging, as Girgis and Vedante suggested for&nbsp;some cases. Then the question becomes whether the field tests are representative of the current fleet of transformers in operation.</p>

<p>My&nbsp;last&nbsp;conclusion is practical. The empirical questions relating to transformers and grids are easier to answer than most in the social sciences or, for that matter, in astrophysics, because experiments can be run. And with so little research done, we are probably&nbsp;shy of the point of diminishing returns. With money, much more could be learned about the vulnerability of transformers and grids. The same goes for mathematical modeling: with modest expenditure, models could be built in the public domain that would be subject to broad scientific scrutiny and empirical testing.</p>

<p>Such investment in empirical&nbsp;and theoretical research would be worthwhile, for it might lead&nbsp;us to&nbsp;confirm&nbsp;and curtail&nbsp;a major vulnerability&nbsp;of modern civilization.</p>

"502","Geomagnetic Storms: Using Extreme Value Theory to Gauge the Risk","<p><em>This is the third post in <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/topic/Geomagnetic+Storms"">a series about geomagnetic storms</a> as a <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/open-philanthropy-project-update-global-catastrophic-risks"">global catastrophic risk</a>. A paper covering the material in this series was <a href=""http://files.givewell.org/files/labs/geomagnetic-storms/The_risk_of_geomagnetic_storms_5_dr.pdf"">just released</a>.</em></p>

<p>My&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/geomagnetic-storms-historys-surprising-if-tentative-reassurance"">last post</a>&nbsp;examined the strength of&nbsp;certain major geomagnetic storms that occurred before the advent of the modern electrical grid, as well as a solar&nbsp;event in 2012 that <em>could</em>&nbsp;have caused a major storm on earth if it had happened a few weeks earlier or later. I concluded that the observed worst cases over the last 150+ years are probably not more than twice as intense as the major storms that <em>have</em>&nbsp;happened since modern grids were built, notably in 1982, 1989, and 2003.</p>

<p>But that analysis was in a sense informal. Using a branch of statistics&nbsp;called Extreme Value Theory (EVT),&nbsp;we can look&nbsp;more systematically at what the historical record tells us about the future. The method is not magic &ndash; it cannot reliably divine the scale&nbsp;of a 1000-year storm&nbsp;from 10 years of data &ndash; but through the familiar language&nbsp;of probability and confidence intervals it can discipline&nbsp;extrapolations with appropriate doses of uncertainty. This post brings EVT to geomagnetic storms.</p>

<p>For intuition about EVT, consider the storm-time disturbance (<em>D<sub>st</sub></em>) index introduced in the last post, which represents the average depression in the magnetic field at the surface of the earth at&nbsp;low latitudes. You can <a href=""http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dst_final/index.html"">download the&nbsp;<em>D<sub>st</sub></em>&nbsp;for every&nbsp;<em>hour</em> since 1957</a>: half a million data points and counting. I took this data set,&nbsp;split&nbsp;it randomly into some 5,000 groups of 100 data points, averaged each group, and then graphed the results.&nbsp;Knowing nothing about the <em>distribution</em>&nbsp;of hourly <em>D<sub>st</sub></em> &ndash; does it follow a bell curve, or have two humps, or drop sharply&nbsp;below&nbsp;some threshold, or a have long left&nbsp;tail? &ndash; I was nevertheless confident that the averages of random groups of 100 values would approximate&nbsp;a bell curve.&nbsp;A cornerstone of&nbsp;statistics,&nbsp;the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem"">Central Limit Theorem</a>, says this will happen. Whenever you hear a pollster quote margins of error, she is banking on the&nbsp;Central Limit Theorem.</p>

<p><!--more-->It looks like my confidence was rewarded:</p>

<p>{image_1}</p>

<p>(<em>D<sub>st</sub></em>&nbsp;is usually&nbsp;negative. Here, I&#39;ve negated&nbsp;all values so the rightmost values indicate the largest magnetic disturbances. I&#39;ll retain this convention.)</p>

<p>Bell curves vary in their center and their spread. This one can be characterized as being centered at 15 nanotesla (nT) and having&nbsp;about 95%&nbsp;of its area&nbsp;between 10 and 20. In a formal analysis, I would find the center and spread values (mean and variance) for the bell curve that best fit the data. I could then precisely calculate the fraction of the time when, according to the perfect bell curve that best fits the data, the average of 100 randomly chosen&nbsp;<em>D<sub>st</sub></em>&nbsp;readings is between,&nbsp;say, 15 and 20&nbsp;nT.</p>

<p>What&nbsp;the Central Limit Theorem does for&nbsp;averages, Extreme Value Theory does for&nbsp;extremes, such as&nbsp;100-year geomagnetic storms and&nbsp;1000-year floods. For example, if I had taken the <em>maximum</em> of each random group of 100 data points rather than the <em>average</em>, EVT tells me that the distribution would have followed a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_extreme_value_distribution"">particular mathematical form, called Generalized Extreme Value.</a>&nbsp;It is&nbsp;rather like the bell curve but possibly skewed left or right. I could find the curve in this family that best fits the data, then trace it&nbsp;toward infinity to estimate, for example, the&nbsp;odds of the biggest&nbsp;out of a 100&nbsp;randomly chosen&nbsp;<em>D<sub>st</sub></em>&nbsp;readings exceeding&nbsp;589; that was the level of the 1989 storm that caused the Qu&eacute;bec blackout.</p>

<p>EVT can also speak directly to how fast the&nbsp;tails of distributions decay toward zero. For example, in the graph above, the left and right tails of the approximate&nbsp;curve both decay&nbsp;to zero. What matters for understanding the odds of extreme events is how <em>fast</em> the decline happens as one moves along the right tail.&nbsp;It turns out that as you move out along a&nbsp;tail, the remaining section of the tail normally&nbsp;comes to resemble&nbsp;to some&nbsp;member of another family of curves, called <a href=""http://affect.media.mit.edu/projectpages/affective_cognitive_decision_making/DM%20Experiment/stats/html/gparetodemo.html"">Generalized Pareto</a>. The family embraces these possibilities:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Finite upper bound.</em>&nbsp;There is some hard maximum. For example,&nbsp;perhaps the physics of solar activity limit how strong storms can be.</li>
	<li><em>Exponential. </em>Suppose we define a &quot;storm&quot; as any time <em>D<sub>st</sub></em> exceeds 100. If storms are exponentially distributed, it can&nbsp;happen&nbsp;that&nbsp;50% of storms&nbsp;have <em>D<sub>st</sub></em>&nbsp;between 100 and 200, 25% between 200 and 300, 12.5% between 300 and 400, 6.25% between 400 and 500, and so on, halving the share for each 100-point rise in storm strength. The decay toward zero is rapid, but never complete. As a result,&nbsp;a storm of strength 5000&nbsp;(in this artificial example) is&nbsp;<em>possible</em> but would be unexpected even over the lifetime of the sun. And it happens that the all-time&nbsp;average&nbsp;<em>D<sub>st</sub></em>&nbsp;would work out to 245.{footnote_1}</li>

The power law differs subtly but importantly.&nbsp;If storms are power law&nbsp;distributed, it can&nbsp;happen&nbsp;that 50% of storms&nbsp;have <em>D<sub>st</sub></em>&nbsp;between 100 and 200, 25% between 200 and 400, 12.5% between 400 and 800, 6.25% between 800 and 1600, and so on, halving the share for each doubling of the range rather than each 100-point rise as before.&nbsp;Notice how the power law has a fatter tail than the exponential, assigning, for instance, more probability to storms above 400&nbsp;(25% vs. 12.5%). In fact, in this power law example, the all-time average storm strength is <em>infinite</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having assured us that the extremes in the historical record almost always&nbsp;fall into&nbsp;one of these cases, or some mathematical blend thereof, EVT lets us search for the best fit within this family of&nbsp;distributions. With the best fit in hand, we can then estimate&nbsp;the chance per unit time of a storm that exceeds any given threshold. We&nbsp;can also compute confidence intervals, which, if wide, should prevent overconfident extrapolation.</p>

<p>In my full report, I review&nbsp;studies that use statistics to extrapolate from the historical record. Two use&nbsp;EVT (<a href=""http://doi.org/10.1029/2007SW000329"">Tsubouchi and Omura 2007</a>;&nbsp;<a href=""http://doi.org/10.1029/2011SW000696"">Thomson, Dawson, and Reay 2011</a>), and thus in my view are&nbsp;the best grounded in statistical theory. However, the study that has exercised the most influence outside of academia is <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1029/2011SW000734"">Riley (2012)</a>, which estimates that &quot;the probability of another&nbsp;Carrington event (based on Dst &lt; -850 nT) occurring within the next decade is 12%.&quot; 12% per decade is a lot, if the consequence would be catastrophe. &quot;1 in 8 Chance of Catastrophic Solar Megastorm by 2020&quot; <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2012/02/massive-solar-flare/"">blared a <em>Wired</em> headline</a>.&nbsp;A few months after this&nbsp;dramatic finding hit the world, the July 2012 coronal mass ejection (CME)&nbsp;missed it, eventually generating additional press (see <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/geomagnetic-storms-historys-surprising-if-tentative-reassurance"">previous post</a>). &quot;The solar storm of 2012 that almost sent us back to a post-apocalyptic Stone Age&quot; (<a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/186805-the-solar-storm-of-2012-that-almost-sent-us-back-to-a-post-apocalyptic-stone-age"">extremetech.com</a>).</p>

<p>However, I&nbsp;see two problems in the analysis behind the 12%/decade number. First, the analysis&nbsp;<em>assumes</em>&nbsp;that extreme geomagnetic storms obey the fat-tailed power law distribution, which automatically leads to higher probabilities for giant storms. It&nbsp;does not test this assumption.{footnote_2} Neither statistical theory, in the form of EVT, nor the state of knowledge in solar physics, assures&nbsp;that the power law governs geomagnetic extremes. The second problem is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of confidence intervals to convey the uncertainty.{footnote_3}</p>

<p>To illustrate and partially correct these problems, I ran my own analysis (and <a href=""http://davidroodman.com/blog/2015/01/25/new-package-for-extreme-value-analysis-in-stata/"">wrote an EVT&nbsp;Stata module</a>&nbsp;to do it). Stata data and code are <a href=""http://files.givewell.org/files/labs/geomagnetic-storms/Roodman_geomagnetic_storm_data_code_and_spreadsheets.zip"">here</a>. Copying the recipe of&nbsp;<a href=""http://doi.org/10.1029/2007SW000329"">Tsubouchi and Omura (2007)</a>, I define a geomagnetic storm event as any observation above&nbsp;100 nT, and I treat any such observations within 48 hours of each other as part of the same event.{footnote_4} This graph depicts the 373 resulting events. For each event, it plots the fraction of all events its size or larger, as a function of its strength. For example, we see that 10% (0.1) of storm events were above 250 nT, which I&#39;ve highlighted with a red dot. The biggest event, the 1989 storm, also gets a&nbsp;red dot; and I added a line to show the <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2005.02.102"">estimated strength of the &quot;Carrington event</a>,&quot; that superstorm of 1859:</p>

<p>{image_2}</p>

<p>Below about 300, the data seem to follow a straight line. Since both axes of the graph are logarithmic (with .01, .1, 1 spaced equally) it works out that a straight line here does indicate power law behavior. However toward the right side, the contour seems to bend downward toward.</p>

<p>In the next graph,&nbsp;I add best-fit contours. Copying Riley, the purple line is fit to all events above 120; as just mentioned, straight lines correspond to power laws. Modeling the&nbsp;tail with the&nbsp;more flexible, conservative, and theoretically grounded Generalized Pareto distribution leads to the orange curve.{footnote_5} It better fits&nbsp;the biggest, most relevant storms (above 300) and when extended out to the Carrington level produces a far lower probability estimate:</p>

<p>{image_3}</p>

<p>Finally, I add 95% confidence intervals to both projections. Since these can include zero, I drop the logarithmic scaling of the vertical axis, which allows zero to appear at the bottom left. Then, for clarity, I zoom in on the rightmost data, for <em>D<sub>st</sub></em>&nbsp;300 and up. Although the&nbsp;black dots in the new&nbsp;graph appear to be arranged differently, they&nbsp;are the same data points as those above 300 in the old graph:</p>

<p>{image_4}</p>

<p>The Riley-style power law extrapolation, in purple, hits the red Carrington line at&nbsp;.00299559, which is to say, 0.3% of storms are&nbsp;Carrington-strength or worse. Since there were 373 storm events over some six&nbsp;decades (the data cover 1957&ndash;2014), this works out to a 17.6% chance per decade, which is in the same ballpark as Riley&#39;s 12%. The 95% confidence interval is 9.4&ndash;31.8%/decade. In contrast, the best fit rooted in Extreme Value Theory, in orange, crosses the Carrington line at just .0000516,&nbsp;meaning each storm event has just&nbsp;a&nbsp;0.005% chance&nbsp;of reaching that level. In per-decade terms, that is just 0.33%, with a confidence interval of 0.0&ndash;4.0%.{footnote_6}</p>

<p>The central estimate&nbsp;of 0.33%/decade does&nbsp;look&nbsp;a bit low. Notice that the rightmost dot above, for 1989, sits toward the high end of the orange bar marking the 95% confidence interval: my model views such a large event as mildly improbable over such a short time span. Moreover,&nbsp;if 0.33%/decade is the right number, then there was only&nbsp;about a 20&times;0.33% = 6.6% chance of Carrington-scale event&nbsp;in the&nbsp;20 decades since the industrial&nbsp;revolution &ndash; and yet it happened. Nevertheless, the 95%&nbsp;confidence interval of&nbsp;of 0.0&ndash;4.0% easily embraces both big storms.&nbsp;I therefore feel comfortable&nbsp;in viewing Riley&#39;s&nbsp;12%/decade risk estimate as an unrepresentative extrapolation from history. The EVT-based estimate is better grounded in statistical theory and comes from a model that better fits the data. So are we in the clear on geomagnetic storms? As I wrote last time, I don&#39;t think so. The historical record exploited here spans less than six decades, which is approximately nothing in the time scale of solar history. We should not&nbsp;assume we have seen most of what the sun can send our way. There are many limitations&nbsp;in this analysis. As noted in the <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/geomagnetic-storms-historys-surprising-if-tentative-reassurance"">last post</a>, the&nbsp;<em>D<sub>st</sub></em>&nbsp;index is an imperfect proxy for the degree of rapid magnetic change at high latitudes that may most threaten grids. Though a <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2005.02.102"">careful estimate</a>,&nbsp;850 might be the wrong value for the Carrington event.</p>

<p>And the higher end of the confidence interval, 4%, is worth&nbsp;worrying about <em>if</em>&nbsp;another Carrington could mean a long-term, wide-scale blackout.</p>

"498","Geomagnetic Storms: History's Surprising, If Tentative, Reassurance","<p><em>This is the second post in <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/topic/Geomagnetic+Storms"">a series about geomagnetic storms</a> as a <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/open-philanthropy-project-update-global-catastrophic-risks"">global catastrophic risk</a>. A paper covering the material in this series was <a href=""http://davidroodman.com/david/The%20risk%20of%20geomagnetic%20storms%205%20dr.pdf"">just released</a>.</em></p>

<p>My <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/geomagnetic-storms-an-introduction-to-the-risk"">last post</a>&nbsp;raised the specter of a geomagnetic storm so strong&nbsp;it would black out electric power across continent-scale regions for months or years, triggering&nbsp;an economic and humanitarian disaster.</p>

<p>How likely is that? One relevant source of knowledge is the historical record of geomagnetic disturbances, which is what this post considers. In approaching the geomagnetic storm issue, I had read some alarming statements to the effect that global society is overdue for the geomagnetic &quot;Big One.&quot;&nbsp;So I was surprised to find <em>reassurance</em> in the past. In my view, the most worrying&nbsp;extrapolations from the historical record do not properly represent it.</p>

<p>I hasten to emphasize that this historical analysis is only&nbsp;part of the overall geomagnetic storm risk assessment. Many uncertainties should leave us uneasy, from our incomplete understanding of the sun&nbsp;to the historically novel reliance of today&#39;s grid operators on satellites that are themselves vulnerable to space weather. And&nbsp;since the scientific record stretches back only 30&ndash;150 years&nbsp;(depending on the indicator) and big storms happen about once a decade, the sample&nbsp;is too small&nbsp;to support&nbsp;sure&nbsp;extrapolations of&nbsp;extremes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless&nbsp;the historical record and claims based on it are the&nbsp;focus in this and the next post. I&#39;ll examine&nbsp;four (kinds of) extrapolations that have been made from the record: from&nbsp;the last &quot;Big One,&quot; the Carrington event of 1859; from the July 2012 coronal mass ejection (CME) that might have caused a storm as large if it had hit Earth; a more complex extrapolation in&nbsp;<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141212171915/http:/web.ornl.gov/sci/ees/etsd/pes/pubs/ferc_Meta-R-319.pdf"">Kappenman (2010)</a>; and the formal statistical extrapolation of <a href=""http://www.webcitation.org/6TW64i8ZT"">Riley (2012)</a>. I&#39;ll save the last for the next post.</p>

<h2>The Carrington event</h2>

<p>A series of CMEs starting in late August&nbsp;1859 caused an extraordinary, global geomagnetic storm. It came to be named for astronomer Richard Carrington, who linked the events&nbsp;on earth to an&nbsp;intense solar flare he had observed on the sun hours before. The&nbsp;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859"">Carrington event</a>&nbsp;produced&nbsp;spectacular auroras <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20150419044521/http://www.leif.org/research/1859%20Storm%20-%20Extreme%20Space%20Weather.pdf#page=11"">as far south, in the northern hemisphere, as San Salvador and as far north, in the southern hemisphere, as Santiago</a>. Vivid reports were made from around the world. <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=9CdGAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3Ag1ZB8cART7kC&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">Here is one</a> from the Washington Territory of the US:</p>

<blockquote>At 8 P.M. Aug. 28,&nbsp;1859, a diffused light, without definite form, was observed a little east of north, covering&nbsp;about one-fourth of the heavens, which gradually increased to the west, sending across from east to west an arch of a whitish color, the arch itself being much brighter than the circumjacent light&hellip;At 9<sup>h</sup>25<sup>m</sup> P.M. strongly marked rays became visible, which rising from the horizon converged to a point on the arch a little south of the zenith, and in this position remained visible about one hour. The rays in the northwest were of a pink color, those in the southeast were purple, alternately brightening and fading to a whitish color. At midnight, all disappeared except the arch, and at intervals undulating flashes of light appeared not visible longer than three seconds. Occasionally streamers shot up from the horizon, the lower part disappearing before the upper part had reached the zenith. Sometimes these streamers were broad at the horizon, and came to a point near the zenith, and sometimes the reverse.</blockquote>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.4em;"">The storm hardly&nbsp;harmed human societies: it&nbsp;temporarily </span><a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20081130025238/http:/www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/spaceweather08_green.pdf#page=18"" style=""line-height: 1.4em;"">disrupted&nbsp;telegraph communications</a><span style=""line-height: 1.4em;"">.&nbsp;Yet because of its apparent strength, the Carrington event of 1859 occupies a special place in the minds of those concerned about geomagnetic storms. It is the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, whose repetition is statistically inevitable. And&nbsp;next time global society may&nbsp;be much more vulnerable.</span></p>

<p>A critical question in assessing that vulnerability is:&nbsp;how much bigger was Carrington than the geomagnetic storms that&nbsp;<em>have</em> hit since the development of modern grids, which civilization has shrugged off? The paucity&nbsp;of high-quality scientific measurements from 1859 impedes comparisons (some&nbsp;magnetometers&nbsp;were operating, but went off scale). But scientists have made the most of the available data. The table below compares the Carrington event to more recent storms on several measures.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important comparison is in the last row. The storm-time disturbance (<em>D<sub>st</sub></em>) index measures the change in Earth&#39;s magnetic field, <a href=""http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dstdir/dst2/onDstindex.html"">as measured at four low-latitude observatories</a>; it roughly proxies the overall geomagnetic impact of a storm. The <em>D<sub>st </sub></em>has <a href=""http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dst_final/index.html"">only been compiled since 1957;</a>&nbsp;scientists <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2005.02.102"">estimate</a> that the Carrington event would have registered at roughly &ndash;850 nanotesla. As shown in the table, the biggest value on record is&nbsp;&ndash;589 nT; it&nbsp;<a href=""http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dst_final/198903/index.html"">occurred on March 14, 1989</a>, which is when the&nbsp;Qu&eacute;bec grid collapsed for some hours and permanently lost two transformers. (Last Tuesday a pretty-big CME <a href=""http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dst_realtime/201506/index.html"">drove the <em>D<sub>st</sub></em> to &ndash;195</a>, the <a href=""http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dst_final/200505/index.html"">largest reading in 10 years</a>.) This and the other comparisons in the table suggest that the Carrington storm was, conservatively, no more than twice as strong&nbsp;as modern events.</p>

<h2>The July 2012 near-miss</h2>

<p>Another important comparator is the major CME of July 23, 2012. That CME missed Earth&nbsp;because&nbsp;it left from <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/swe.20097/full#swe20097-fig-0002"">what was then the far side of the sun</a>. However, the NASA probe&nbsp;STEREO-A was travelling along earth&rsquo;s orbit about 4 months ahead of the planet, and lay in the CME&rsquo;s path, while STEREO-B, trailing four months behind earth, was also positioned to observe. The twin probes produced the best measurements ever of a Carrington-class solar event (Baker et al. 2013). Since the sun rotates about its axis in less than a month, had the CME come a couple of weeks sooner or later, it would have smashed into our planet. Two numbers convey the power of the near-miss CME. First is its transit time to earth orbit: at just under 18 hours, almost exactly the same as in the Carrington event.{footnote_1} A slower CME on July 19 <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.6088.pdf"">appears to have cleared the interplanetary medium of solar plasma</a>, resulting in minimal slowdown of the big CME&nbsp;on July 23. The second number is the strength of the component of the CME&rsquo;s magnetic field running parallel to earth&rsquo;s. When&nbsp;a CME&nbsp;hits Earth, it&nbsp;strews the most magnetic chaos if&nbsp;its field parallels Earth&rsquo;s (meaning that both point south); then it is like slamming together two magnetized toy trains the way they don&rsquo;t want to go. The southward component of the magnetic field of the great July 2012 CME <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/swe.20097/full#swe20097-fig-0003"">peaked&nbsp;at 50 nT</a>. Here, however, &ldquo;south&rdquo; means perpendicular to Earth&rsquo;s orbital plane. Since Earth&rsquo;s spin axis is tilted 23.5&deg; and its magnetic poles <a href=""http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/poles/polesexp.html"">deviate from the spin poles by about another 10&deg;</a>, the southerly magnetic force of the near-miss CME,&nbsp;had it hit Earth, could have been more or less than 50 nT, depending on the exact time of day and year. <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/swe.20097/full#swe20097-sec-0002"">Baker et al. (2013, p. 590)</a> estimate the worst case as 70 nT south, relative to earth&rsquo;s magnetic orientation.</p>

<p>For comparison, the graph below shows the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field near earth since 1963, where north and south are also defined by the orientation&nbsp;of earth&rsquo;s magnetic poles. Unfortunately, data are missing for the largest storm in the time range, the one of March 1989.{footnote_2} The graph does reveal a large <em>northerly</em> spike in 1972, <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2002JA009504/full#jgra16692-sec-0004"">which explains why that year&rsquo;s great CME caused minimal disruption</a> despite the record speed noted in the table above. Also shown are large southerly magnetic forces in storms of 1982 and 2003, the latter reaching 50 nT.</p>

<p>{image_1}</p>

<p>Given the near-miss&nbsp;CME&rsquo;s speed, its magnetic field, and its density, how big a storm could it have caused had it hit earth? &nbsp;<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2002JA009504/full#jgra16692-sec-0003"">Baker et al. (2013) estimate</a>&nbsp;that it would have rated between &ndash;480 and &ndash;1182 on the <em>D<sub>st</sub></em> index, depending on the CME&rsquo;s magnetic orientation relative to Earth&rsquo;s at collision.&nbsp;Comparing the high&nbsp;value to the modern record of &ndash;589 again points to a benchmark&nbsp;worst-case storm as being twice as strong as anything experienced since the construction of modern grids. In a companion paper, the same team of scientists ran computer simulations to develop a more sophisticated understanding of what would have happened if earth had been in STEREO-A&rsquo;s place on July 23. <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1002/2013SW000990"">Their results</a> do not point clearly to a counterfactual catastrophe. &ldquo;Had the 23 July CME hit Earth, there is a possibility that it could have produced comparable or slightly larger geomagnetically induced electric fields to those produced by previously observed Earth directed events such as the March 1989 storm or the Halloween 2003 storms.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Kappenman&#39;s factor of 10</h2>

<p>In contrast, the prominent analyst John Kappenman has favored a factor of 10 to characterize&nbsp;the likely&nbsp;100-year&nbsp;storm relative to the strongest recent storms.{footnote_3} Recognizing that this contrast&nbsp;with&nbsp;my interpretation of the evidence begs explanation, I investigated the basis for the factor of 10.&nbsp;It appears to arise as&nbsp;the ratio of two numbers. One represents the worst disruption that geomagnetic storms have wrought in the modern age, meaning, again, the Qu&eacute;bec blackout in March 1989. As Kappenman&nbsp;<a href=""http://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2005.08.055"">points out</a>, just as the Richter scale doesn&#39;t tell you everything about the destructive force of an earthquake in any given spot &ndash; local geology, distance from the epicenter, and building construction quality matter too &ndash; the <em>D<sub>st</sub></em> index doesn&#39;t tell you everything about the capacity of a storm to induce electrical surges in any given place. What matters is not the total perturbation&nbsp;in the magnetic field, globally averaged, but&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>rate</em> of magnetic field change from minute to minute&nbsp;along power lines of concern.{footnote_4} By the laws of electromagnetism, a <em>changing</em> magnetic field induces a voltage; and the faster the change, the bigger the voltage.&nbsp;In&nbsp;Qu&eacute;bec in 1989, the rate of magnetic field change peaked at&nbsp;479 nT/min (nanotesla per minute)&nbsp;<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2003SW000028/full#swe20-sec-0006"">according to Kappenman</a>.</p>

<p>While I did not find a clear citation of source for this statistic, it looks highly plausible. The graph below, based on my own extracts of magnetic observatory data, shows the maximum horizontal field changes at 58 stations on that day in 1989, based on measurements taken every minute, on the minute.

<p>Ottawa (OTT, in red) recorded a peak change of 556 nT/min, between 9:50 and 9:51pm universal time, which is compatible with Kappenman&#39;s 479 for nearby&nbsp;Qu&eacute;bec. Brorfelde recorded the highest value, 1994 nT/min.</p>

<p>The other number in Kappenman&#39;s&nbsp;factor-of-10 ratio represents the highest estimate we have of any per-minute magnetic field change before World War II, at least at a latitude low enough to concern Europe or North America. It comes from Karlstad, in southern Sweden, during the storm of May 13&ndash;15, 1921. The rate of change of the magnetic field was not measured there, but the electric field induced in a telegraph line was reportedly estimated at 20 volts/kilometer (V/km). Calibrating to modern observations, <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2005.08.055"">Kappenman calculates</a>, &ldquo;the 20 V/km observation&hellip;suggests the possibility that the disturbance intensity approached a level of 5000 nT/min.&rdquo; <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141212171915/http:/web.ornl.gov/sci/ees/etsd/pes/pubs/ferc_Meta-R-319.pdf#page=101"">Elsewhere</a> Kappenman suggests 4800 nT/min. And 4800/479 is just about&nbsp;10. That is, the worst case on&nbsp;record looks to be 10 times as bad as what caused the&nbsp;Qu&eacute;bec blackout.</p>

<p>I have two doubts&nbsp;about this ratio. First, the top number appears to have been unintentionally increased by a scholarly game of telephone. As a source for the 20 V/km observation, Kappenman <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117705012111"">cites</a> &ndash; and correctly represents &ndash; a <a href=""http://e-cigre.org/Order/select.asp?ID=7014"">1992 conference paper by Elovaara et al.</a>, who write, &ldquo;The earth surface potentials produced are typically characterized by the value 1 V/km, but in extreme cases much higher values has been recorded like 20 V/km in a wire communication system in Sweden in May 1922 [<em>sic</em>].&rdquo; No source is given there; but Jarmo Elovaara pointed me to <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1961.1097724"">Sanders (1961)</a> as likely. Indeed, there&nbsp;we read, &ldquo;In May, 1921, during an outstanding magnetic storm, the largest earth-current voltages measured on wirelines in Sweden ranged from 6.3 to 20 v/km.&rdquo; The cited source for <em>that</em> range is the &ldquo;Earth Currents&rdquo; article of the 1943 <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em>, <a href=""http://1drv.ms/1wBGxci"">which states</a>: &ldquo;In May 1921, during an outstanding magnetic storm, Stenquist calculated from the fusing of some copper wires and the non-fusing of others that the largest earth current voltage in Sweden lay between 6.3 and 20 volts per kilometre.&rdquo; &ldquo;Stenquist&rdquo; is David Stenquist, a Swedish telegraph engineer who in 1925 published <em>&Eacute;tude des Courants Telluriques</em> (<em>Study of Earth Currents</em>). The pertinent passage thereof comes on page 54:</p>

<p>{image_3}</p>

<p>Translation:</p>

<blockquote>Nevertheless I tried to calculate the largest value of telluric [earth] currents. Until now, standard opinion was that the largest potential differences in the earth because of telluric currents are two volts per kilometer. During the nights of May 13&ndash;14 and 14&ndash;15, this value was greatly exceeded. In many cases the currents were so strong in the lines of copper (3 mm [millimeters]), the conduits melted, i.e. the current exceeded 2.5 amps. Because the copper wire just mentioned had a resistance of 2.5 ohms per kilometer, we get a potential difference of 6.3 volts per kilometer. In contrast, the [fusion tubes?] placed on the iron lines (4 mm) did not melt. These iron lines have a resistance of 8 ohms per kilometer. So it is known that 20 volts did not occur. With a large enough security to speak, a difference of 10 volts per kilometer was found.</blockquote>

<p>Stenquist believed the electric force field reached 10 V/km but explicitly rejected 20. Yet through the chain of citations, &ldquo;20 volts n&rsquo;ont pas &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;-pass&eacute;s&rdquo; became &ldquo;higher values has been recorded like 20 V/km.&rdquo; Using Kappenman&rsquo;s rule of thumb, Stenquist&rsquo;s 10 V/km electrical force field suggests peaks of 2500 rather than 5000 nT/min of magnetic change on that dark and geomagnetically stormy night in Karlstad.</p>

<p>The second concern I have about the estimated ratio of 10 between magnetic fluctuations in the distant and recent past is that it appears to compare apples to oranges&mdash;an isolated, global peak&nbsp;value in one storm to a wide-area value&nbsp;in another. As we have already seen, the highest value observed in 1989 was not the 479 Kappenman uses to represent that storm but 1994 nT/min, in <a href=""http://www.intermagnet.org/imos/imos-list/imos-details-eng.php?iaga_code=BFE"">Brorfelde</a>. And back in July 13&ndash;14, 1982, the <a href=""http://www.intermagnet.org/imos/imos-list/imos-details-eng.php?iaga_code=LOV"">Lovo observatory</a>, at the same latitude as Karlstad, experienced 2688 nT/min according to my calculations from the <a href=""http://www.geo.fmi.fi/image/reqform/dataform.html"">public data</a>. Both instances were isolated: most observatories of comparable latitude reported&nbsp;much lower peaks. It is therefore not clear that the 1921 storm, with its isolated observation of 2500 nT/min, exceeded those of the 1980s at all, let alone by a factor of 10. Maximum magnetic changes and voltages may have been the same.</p>

<p>While there is apparently no evidence that fluctuations as great as 4800 nT/min have happened over large areas, Kappenman&#39;s <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141212171915/http:/web.ornl.gov/sci/ees/etsd/pes/pubs/ferc_Meta-R-319.pdf#page=120"">simulated 100-year storm</a>&nbsp;scenario&nbsp;assumes that extremes of this order would occur across the US in a 5-degree <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141212171915/http:/web.ornl.gov/sci/ees/etsd/pes/pubs/ferc_Meta-R-319.pdf#page=103"">band centered on 50&deg; N geomagnetic latitude</a> (an area 350 miles wide north-south, 3,000 long east-west) &ndash; 4800 nT/min east of the Mississippi and 2400 nT/min to the west. The associated&nbsp;estimate that a 100-year storm <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20081130024913/http:/www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/spaceweather08_kappenman.pdf#page=9"">would put&nbsp;365 high-voltage transformers at risk of permanent damage</a>, out of <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141212171915/http:/web.ornl.gov/sci/ees/etsd/pes/pubs/ferc_Meta-R-319.pdf#page=27"">some 2,146 in service</a>, affect regions home to 130 million people, and reduce economic output by <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20081130024913/http:/www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/spaceweather08_kappenman.pdf#page=10"">trillions of dollars</a>, entered&nbsp;an <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=Severe+Space+Weather+Events--Understanding+Societal+and+Economic+Impacts+Workshop+Report&amp;oq=Severe+Space+Weather+Events--Understanding+Societal+and+Economic+Impacts+Workshop+Report&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.335j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8"">oft-cited</a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nap.edu/download.php?record_id=12507"">National Research Council conference report</a>. Yet to me, this seems like a highly unrepresentative extrapolation from history.</p>

<p>I found one other independent review of the Kappenman analysis. It was commissioned in 2011 by the US Department of Homeland Security from JASON, a group of scientists that advises the government on issues at the intersection of science and security. The <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150323064441/http://fas.org/irp/agency/dod/jason/spaceweather.pdf#page=8"">JASON report concludes</a>: &quot;Because mitigation has not been widely applied to the U.S. electric&nbsp;grid, severe damage is a possibility, but a rigorous risk assessment has&nbsp;not been done. We are not convinced that the worst-case scenario of&nbsp;[Kappenman] is plausible. Nor is the analysis it is based on, using proprietary&nbsp;algorithms, suitable for deciding national policy....[W]e are unlikely to experience geomagnetic storms&nbsp;an order-of-magnitude more intense than those observed to date.&quot;</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Despite some spectacular reports from 1859 Carrington event and some equally spectacular scenario forecasts, to this point in our inquiry, the historical record appears surprisingly reassuring. There is little suggestion that the Carrington event &ndash; or any other in the last two centuries &ndash; was more than twice as strong&nbsp;as the biggest storms of&nbsp;recent decades, in 1982, 1989, and 2003. And civilization shrugged those off, with only a few high-voltage transformers taken out of commission. This does not prove geomagnetic storms pose&nbsp;no global catastrophic risk; like the JASON group, I don&#39;t feel we can rule that out. But it does lead us to more focussed questions: What are the risks posed by a doubling of storm strength relative to recent experience? Under what assumptions would&nbsp;the effects be extremely disproportionate to the increase in magnetic disruption? What steps could be taken to change that? In fact, I don&#39;t feel that I have satisfactory answers to those questions. The area appears under-researched, and that may point to an opportunity for philanthropy. But I get ahead of myself. In the next post, I will make a final&nbsp;approach on&nbsp;the historical record, this&nbsp;one&nbsp;more systematic and statistical. I think it&#39;s important but it will not change the conclusion much.</p>

"494","Geomagnetic Storms: An Introduction to the Risk","<p><em>This post is the first in <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/topic/Geomagnetic+Storms"">a series on geomagnetic storms</a>.</em></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org"">Open Philanthropy Project</a> has included <em><a href=""http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/geomagnetic-storms"">geomagnetic storms</a></em> in its list of <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/potential-global-catastrophic-risk-focus-areas"">global catastrophic risks of potential focus</a>.</p>

<p>To be honest, I hadn&#39;t heard of them either. But when I was consulting for GiveWell&nbsp;last&nbsp;fall, program officer <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/about/people"">Howie Lempel</a> asked me to investigate the risks they pose. (Now I&#39;m an employee of GiveWell.)</p>

<p>It turns out that geomagnetic storms are caused by&nbsp;cataclysms on the sun, which fling magnetically charged matter toward earth. The&nbsp;collisions can rattle earth&#39;s magnetic field, sending power surges through electrical grids. The high-speed particles&nbsp;can&nbsp;also take out satellites critical for communication and navigation. The main fear&nbsp;is that an extreme storm would so damage electrical grids as to black out power&nbsp;on a continental scale for months, even years. The toll of such a disaster would be&nbsp;tallied&nbsp;in economic terms, presumably in the trillions of dollars. It would&nbsp;also be measured in lives lost,&nbsp;since all the essential infrastructure of civilization, from food transport&nbsp;to law enforcement, now depends on being able to plug things in and turn them on (<a href=""http://www.nap.edu/download.php?record_id=12507"">NRC 2008</a>, pp. 11&ndash;12).</p>

<p>Having examined the issue, especially its statistical aspects, I am not convinced that this scenario is as likely as some prominent voices have&nbsp;suggested. For example, as I will explain in a later post,&nbsp;<a href=""http://doi.org/10.1029/2011SW000734"">Riley&rsquo;s (2012)</a> <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=riley+geomagnetic+storm+12"">oft-cited</a>&nbsp;estimate that an extreme storm &ndash; stronger than any since the advent of the modern grid &ndash; has a 12%-per-decade probability looks like an unrepresentative extrapolation from the historical record. I put the odds&nbsp;lower. My full report <a href=""http://davidroodman.com/david/The%20risk%20of%20geomagnetic%20storms%205%20dr.pdf"">has just been posted</a>, along with <a href=""http://files.givewell.org/files/labs/geomagnetic-storms/Roodman_geomagnetic_storm_data_code_and_spreadsheets.zip"">data, code, and spreadsheets</a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my reassurance is layered in uncertainty. The historical scientific record is short &ndash; we get a big storm&nbsp;about once a decade, and good data have only been collected for 30-150 years depending on the indicator. Scientific understanding of solar&nbsp;dynamics&nbsp;is limited. Likewise for the response of grids&nbsp;to storms. <em>My</em> understanding of the state of knowledge is itself limited. On balance, significant &ldquo;tail risk&rdquo; &ndash; of events extreme enough to cause great suffering &ndash; should not be ruled out.</p>

<p>This is why I think the geomagnetic storm risk, even if overestimated by some, deserves&nbsp;more attention from governments than it is receiving. To date, the&nbsp;attention has been minimal relative to the stakes. The rest of this post delineates how geomagnetic storms come about and why they may particularly threaten one critical component of modern electrical grids, the high-voltage transformer. Later posts will delve into what the available evidence says about the chance of a geomagnetic &quot;perfect storm.&quot;</p>

<h2>How turbulence&nbsp;on the sun&nbsp;produces power surges on earth</h2>

<p>A distinctive feature of the geomagnetic storm issue is the sequential, probabilistic nature of the phenomenon of concern. The&nbsp;storms originate in cataclysmic explosions on the face&nbsp;of the sun with the power of a billion hydrogen bombs.{footnote_1}&nbsp;Each event may throw off some amount of magnetically charged plasma &ndash; from&nbsp;tens of megatons to&nbsp;tens of gigatons (<a href=""http://doi.org/10.1007/BF02702527"">Gopalswamy 2006</a>, p. 244). In the abstract, this&nbsp;coronal mass ejection (CME)&nbsp;has some probability of hitting the earth, which&nbsp;depends on the CME&#39;s&nbsp;angular breadth. If the CME&nbsp;hits, it will do so at some speed, perhaps as high as 1% of the speed of light, 3,000 kilometers per second. The CME&rsquo;s magnetic field may by chance point substantially in the same direction as the earth&rsquo;s, producing a magnetic collision (<a href=""http://doi.org/10.1007/BF02702527"">Gopalswamy 2006</a>, p. 248) rather like slamming together two magnets the way they don&rsquo;t want to go. Sometimes several CMEs will fly out over a few days, the first clearing a path through interstellar matter and&nbsp;speeding the transit of its successors. Each magnetic blast will, over hours or days, bend&nbsp;the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. This will accelerate electrical currents that flow at great heights above the planet, such as&nbsp;the &quot;electrojets&quot; that cause the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis. The gusts of solar weather will also strew turbulence in the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field, like a strong wind over water (<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004SW000128/pdf"">Kappenman 2005</a>, p. 6), producing even sharper, if more transient and localized, magnetic oscillations across the surface of the earth. Scientists will declare the arrival of a geomagnetic storm.</p>

<p>According to the laws of electromagnetism, when the magnetic field fluctuates in a spot, it induces a voltage there. The faster the magnetic change, the greater the voltage. Before the Industrial Revolution, electrical pressures induced by magnetic storms could only be relieved by the flow of electric charge through air, sea, or land. But now people have laced the planet with less resistive conduits: high-voltage power lines stretching hundreds of miles. Especially when crossing terrain whose (igneous) mineralogy resists electrical current &ndash; or when terminating near conductive seawater &ndash; and especially when the wires happen to align with the induced electrical force, these cables become geomagnetic lightning rods.</p>

<h2>How power surges&nbsp;threaten grids</h2>

<p>Like lightning rods, long-distance, high-voltage&nbsp;power lines are grounded: for safety, they are connected to the earth at either end. But at each end of most of these power lines, interposed between them and the earth, are transformers, garage-sized or bigger.</p>

<p>Transformers&nbsp;put the &ldquo;high-voltage&rdquo; in &ldquo;high-voltage power line.&rdquo; In preparation for long-distance transmission, the transformers take the electricity produced by a windfarm or coal plant and step up its voltage,&nbsp;to as high as 765,000 volts in the US. They feed this transformed electrical energy into the long-distance lines.&nbsp;(Boosting the voltage for long-distance transmission cuts energy losses from the electrical resistance of the power lines.)&nbsp;At the receiving end, similar transformers symmetrically step the voltage back down for distribution to factories, offices, and homes.</p>

<p>Transformers exploit the symmetry of electromagnetism: just as a changing magnetic field induces a voltage, so does the movement of electrical charge (electricity) produce a magnetic field. Inside each transformer, two wires, one connected to the input line and one to the output, coil hundreds of times within or around a shared core of magnetically permeable material such as silicon steel. The normal input is alternating current (AC), like that in an ordinary home, its voltage flipping from positive to negative and back 50 or 60 times a second. The oscillating electricity in the wire produces an oscillating magnetic field in the transformer&rsquo;s core. That in turn induces an oscillating current in the output wire, typically at a different voltage. The capacity of AC to be transformed in this way for low-loss, long-distance transmission is precisely why at the dawn of the electrical age AC beat out DC &ndash; constant, &quot;direct&quot; current &ndash; as the standard for power systems.</p>

<p>Under design conditions, a transformer&rsquo;s core is magnetically capacious enough to carry the whole field produced by the input wire. But if too strong&nbsp;a current enters, the core will <em>saturate</em>. Magnetic force fields will stray out of the core and into the surrounding wires, where they can exact invisible mayhem: random currents in both the input and output wires and &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo; of burnt insulation. Possibly, the transformer will fail immediately. Or it may continue operating while the hot spots cool into something analogous to dots of rust: they escape attention at first, but initiate degradation that spreads over weeks or months. Eventually a failure may be triggered, which engineers may not even recognize as storm damage (<a href=""http://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1973.293746"">Albertson et al. 1973</a>, p. 475; <a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4538419"">Gaunt and Coetzee 2007</a>, p. 444). High-voltage transformers are nodes in the grid. When they fail, links in the power system&nbsp;are sundered.</p>

<p>Geomagnetic storms can send damaging currents into transformers in two ways. The storms can directly induce them, as just described. Or the storms can disrupt currents, voltages, and frequencies in an operating grid enough to overwhelm the equipment meant to counteract such distortions, and thus trigger shutdowns of power plants or disconnections between sections of the grid. These automatic responses are designed to protect the grid, and may largely do so&mdash;but perhaps not completely in extreme cases. In Qu&eacute;bec during the great storm of March 1989, the sudden disconnection of the La Grande hydroelectric dam complex from the rest of the grid overloaded and damaged&nbsp;two big transformers, part of a larger cascade of events that led to a widespread blackout (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20111102163541/http:/www.nerc.com/files/1989-Quebec-Disturbance.pdf#page=7"">NERC 1990, p. 42</a>).</p>

<p>A wildcard that has emerged since 1989 is that a storm might damage GPS and communications satellites, which utilities have increasingly used to coordinate components of the grid. (Giant generators spinning at 50 or 60 times per second, hundreds of miles apart, must be precisely synchronized if serving the same grid.)</p>

<h2>Debating the worst-case&nbsp;scenario</h2>

<p>In the worst case, <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141212171915/http:/web.ornl.gov/sci/ees/etsd/pes/pubs/ferc_Meta-R-319.pdf#page=123"">argues geomagnetic storm expert John Kappenman</a>, a storm would take out hundreds of high-voltage transformers across a continent-wide area. High-voltage transformers are large, expensive, custom industrial products. There are not a lot of spares around. New ones take months each to manufacture, and limited global production capacity could produce a backlog of years. The effects of a&nbsp;long-term blackout&nbsp;would cascade to all corners of industrial societies &ndash; pipelines, sewage treatment, police, air traffic control, hospitals. The scariest potential consequence is the loss of cooling at storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel, as at Fukushima in 2011 (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20140706024408/http:/www.resilientsocieties.org/images/Petition_For_Rulemaking_Resilient_Societies_Docketed.pdf"">Foundation for Resilient Societies 2011</a>).</p>

<p>Offsetting such risks is the paradoxical resilience built into grids, as seen in Qu&eacute;bec. If a geomagnetic storm sufficiently distorts the current entering or exiting a major transformer, safety equipment trips, shutting it down. Large areas may be blacked out within seconds. But, <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150429230843/http://a2.cigre.org/content/download/33769/1473731/version/1/file/Effects+of+GIC+on+Power+Transformers+and+Power+Systems.pdf"">contend Ramsis Girgis and Kirin Vedante of transformer manufacturer ABB</a>, the quiescent grid may be protected from&nbsp;more permanent damage. Short-term fragility bestows long-term resilience. In Qu&eacute;bec, power was largely restored (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20111102163541/http:/www.nerc.com/files/1989-Quebec-Disturbance.pdf#page=7"">after nine hours</a>), and life went on.</p>

<p>In addition, the power system is arguably more prepared for electrical storm surges today. Satellite-based warning systems are more sophisticated (&ldquo;GoreSat&rdquo; was launched on February 11 to strengthen capacity to monitor solar activity). Since 1989 utility officials have&nbsp;wisened&nbsp;to the danger and are perhaps more ready to preemptively shut down grids to protect them.&nbsp;And some systems have been modified to make them more robust.</p>

<p>In the end, I did not achieve an&nbsp;understanding of power engineering well enough to make a call on these contending considerations. I am convinced, however, that how&nbsp;power systems will&nbsp;respond to extreme geomagnetic storms has been too little researched. Few experiments have been conducted under realistic conditions. Much of what is known is&nbsp;locked in the minds and computers of transformer manufacturers and power system operators, who may have incentives not to share everything they know.</p>

<p>My&nbsp;next few posts will focus on a question I am more competent to explore, which is what the historical record tells us about the probabilities of extreme storms in the future.</p>

<h2><strong style=""font-family: ff-meta-web-pro, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;"">Conversation Summary</strong></h2>

<h3>History and Context</h3>

<p>To begin the meeting, Nadelmann provided a brief history of the scope and evolution of DPA&rsquo;s role in the drug policy reform field. This included his assessment of the context in which he began his early work in the 1980s, a context which he characterized as being fanatical and contrary to fundamental American values. At this point in time, marijuana got caught up in the drug hysteria right along with cocaine and similar &lsquo;hard&rsquo; drugs.</p>

<p>Indeed, there had been some &lsquo;prehistory&rsquo; to this setting, in which the Ford Foundation did progressive work in this area and even Jimmy Carter supported harm reduction-type policies. But, ultimately, the debate became one of total legalization versus total prohibition. There was little to no room for the perspective of addressing the consequences of failed prohibition. The perception was that one was either for the drug war or for legalization, with little to no recognition of the spectrum of drug policy options available.</p>

<p>Harm reduction had emerged as a strategy in Europe in the 70s and caught on elsewhere in the 80s in response to the spread of HIV among people who inject drugs. There were some ideas formulated around how to maximize models that offered controlled alternatives for drug use while still monitoring possible harm to others, but the models did not catch on.</p>

<p>In 1994, George Soros invited Nadelmann to create The Lindesmith Center as the first U.S. project of the Open Society Institute (now called the Open Society Foundations). Nadelmann took on four major responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Building the Center into the leading drug policy reform institute with a mission to educate policymakers, advocates, and academics about the innovative approaches to drug policy reform happening outside of the U.S., including syringe access, heroin maintenance, and supervised injection programs.</li>
	<li>Coordinating the grant-making strategies of the Open Society Institute and the Drug Policy Foundation, a membership and advocacy organization founded in 1988 by Arnold Trebach and Kevin Zeese.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Spearheading ballot initiative efforts and coordinating the funding partnership of George Soros, Peter Lewis, and John Sperling from 1996 to 2002, which resulted in victories on issues including medical marijuana, sentencing reform, and asset forfeiture reform.</li>
	<li>Co-creating the International Harm Reduction Development Program at the Open Society Institute to initiate and support efforts in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2000, the Lindesmith Center spun off from the Open Society Institute and merged with the Drug Policy Foundation to form the Drug Policy Alliance. DPA scaled back its work on ballot initiatives but increased its investments in legislative advocacy campaigns, mostly at the state level. It also began to host the International Drug Policy Reform Conference, an event previously organized annually by the Drug Policy Foundation. Eventually, DPA began managing the grants program that was run through the Drug Policy Foundation and later through the Tides Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Field</h3>

<p>According to Nadelmann, what we have now in the broad movement are four types of reform groups:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>State-level groups.</strong> These are issue-based groups or ones that target broad reform. Nadelmann believes this sector is growing.</li>
	<li><strong>Constituency-based groups.</strong> This group includes: Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP), Religious Leaders for a More Just and Compassionate Drug Policy, the Interfaith Drug Policy Initiative (no longer active), Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP), various parents&rsquo; movements (such as Moms United), and efforts within the African American community (including the Samuel DeWitt Proctor Conference).</li>
	<li><strong>Issue-based groups.</strong> Including: National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML&mdash;representing the marijuana consumer), Marijuana Policy Project (MPP), Americans for Safe Access (ASA), National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW), Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM), the Harm Reduction Coalition (HRC), North American Syringe Exchange Network (NASEN), Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), and the Heffter Research Institute.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Connect-the-dots groups.</strong> This sector includes two small groups such as Common Sense for Drug Policy and DRC-Net, and also DPA.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>There is also an international movement. We did not focus on this in the conversation, but Nadelmann felt it was important to recognize this work. One of the principal goals of DPA is to educate Americans about effective, proven policies and innovations abroad in drug policy reform which we do not typically talk about in the U.S.</p>

<p>Nadelmann believes that support in the U.S. for drug courts and other coercive approaches to drug use and addiction are driven in part by a general unawareness of the success of non-coercive approaches abroad, notably in Portugal and other European countries. He makes the point that non-coercive approaches are proven to be as, or more, effective than coercive approaches in reducing drug-related harms. He believes it is not just good policy but a moral imperative in an open society to embrace non-coercive approaches over coercive ones. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of the differences in approach to marijuana reform and legalization of more addictive drugs, DPA falls on the side of shifting resources from punitive to helpful polices that are health-driven. This includes leveraging the Affordable Care Act and other public resources.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>DPA Priorities</h3>

<p>After the overview of the field, we turned back to DPA&rsquo;s mission and priorities over the next decade. The mission is two-fold: to reduce prohibition and to reduce the harms of drug use. To that end, DPA&rsquo;s four main priorities are:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Remove Marijuana from the Criminal Justice System.</strong> In this area, Nadelmann said, &ldquo;We keep the ball moving down the field.&rdquo; DPA does not advocate for one model of legalization over another, but Nadelmann noted that he would rather not see the &lsquo;Budweiserization&rsquo; of marijuana as an outcome of legalization. DPA wants to get marijuana out of the criminal justice system as much as possible and minimize the negative consequences of its use. Thus, its role in this space varies according to the need. In some cases, DPA primarily provides funding (which is what occurred in Washington); while in other cases it works on &ldquo;the ground game&rdquo; and on legislation (as it did in Colorado). In yet other scenarios (like in Uruguay), it has a staff person on site working on public education and the coordination of local groups.

	<ul>
		<li>On exceptionalism for marijuana, Nadelmann noted that DPA tries to make the most of it to advance legalization while at the same time minimizing the negative consequences for other drug policy reforms and looking for synergy. As an example, DPA regularly encourages other marijuana activists to refrain from demonizing and stigmatizing users of other drugs. Nadelmann emphasized that marijuana reform and other areas have generally moved forward in the U.S. and in foreign countries on parallel tracks. He makes clear that there is no &ldquo;slippery slope&rdquo; from marijuana legalization to the legalization of other drugs.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>End the Criminalization of Drug Possession.</strong> According to Nadelmann, we need to stop arresting and incarcerating people for drug possession while making significant investments in treating drug addiction as a health issue. He believes that the Portugal model&#123;footnote_1&#125;&nbsp;is the basic idea. While Nadelmann points out that legislative reform is necessary to reduce and ultimately end the criminalization of drug possession, he points to the LEAD model (Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion) as the closest thing to the Portugal model in the U.S. LEAD was pioneered in Seattle, and now DPA is deeply involved in adapting it in Santa Fe and in a number of other jurisdictions across the country. Nadelmann says that the movement to end criminalization of possession will take a much different approach than the marijuana movement, with much greater reliance on mobilizing public health officials and winning over law enforcement officials.</li>
	<li><strong>Allow legal access to drugs for people who are unable or unwilling to stop their drug use.</strong> &nbsp;Nadelmann sees this as the single most important design challenge for the drug policy reform movement over the coming generation. This work centers on a small group of users that drives the black market. This is where criminal organizations make their money, so Nadelmann believes we need to design models for people who are addicted to drugs so they can obtain drugs legally and in a way that does not endanger health and public safety. He noted that we need to take European models like heroin maintenance and figure out how to scale and reach more people without making programs so broad that others are in danger. As he stated, &ldquo;we need to get innovative with how we deal with stimulants.&rdquo; For DPA, this is not a legislative effort but rather a matter of turning this work into a research study (which is legal under federal law) and finding courageous, tenured researchers and treatment professionals who want to run it.
	<ul>
		<li>With heroin, Nadelmann felt that there was less of a backlash reaction to Philip Seymour Hoffman&rsquo;s death (despite the rapid response police raid targeting the alleged dealers in this case) than we saw regarding Len Bias&rsquo; death in 1986. The policy reactions today are less about &#39;getting tough&#39; and more about Good Samaritan laws to make overdose deaths less common. For DPA, one core organizational commitment is to advocate for overdose prevention.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>End mass incarceration in the United States.</strong> This is DPA&rsquo;s major priority, advanced by the first three. Drug policy reform, as DPA pursues it, will significantly reduce the number of people behind bars in the United States. Nadelmann wants to see U.S. incarceration rates to be similar to those in other democratic societies, to &ldquo;make America average again.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, Nadelmann summarized DPA&rsquo;s work as &ldquo;intending to reduce the role of criminalization and the criminal justice system to the maximum extent consistent with health and public safety.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Peter Lewis</h3>

<p>We then turned to talk about the impact of the passing of Peter Lewis. To this, Nadelmann responded that Lewis&rsquo; funding had been pivotal for the field, but it is hard to know what Lewis&rsquo; children will decide to do regarding future funding for drug policy reform.</p>

<p>On whether industry could fill the gap left by Lewis, Nadelmann noted that industry stakeholders have so far invested very little in reform, with the notable exception of Richard Lee, the driver of California&rsquo;s 2010 legalization initiative. He anticipates that once marijuana is legalized, industry players will lobby to advance their financial interests, which may have the silver lining of funding advocacy efforts to ensure that marijuana is not recriminalized.</p>

<p>Nadelmann described the growing challenges and opportunities of working with industry stakeholders. He noted that they range from those who are personally very committed apart from their own financial interests, to those who are just looking to make a quick buck. The key for DPA is maneuvering in that world while ensuring that marijuana policies are grounded in DPA&rsquo;s core values.</p>

<h2><strong>Other Opportunities for Targeted Funding in the Field</strong></h2>

<p>To conclude the conversation, we talked about other leading organizations in the field that could benefit from additional financial support. These included:</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href=""http://www.advocatesforpregnantwomen.org/"">National Advocates for Pregnant Women</a> (NAPW). NAPW is headed by Lynn Paltrow, who is a strong speaker and leader. NAPW&rsquo;s work, which addresses the intersection of women&rsquo;s rights, reproductive rights, and drug policy reform, is considered by Nadelmann to be the most challenging in the field.</li>
	<li><a href=""http://harmreduction.org/"">Harm Reduction Coalition</a> (HRC). HRC is led by Allan Clear, who Nadelmann believes to be a very ethical leader.</li>
	<li><a href=""http://famm.org/"">Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM).</a> Headed by Julie Stewart, Nadelmann said FAMM does very important work.</li>
	<li>Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (<a href=""http://www.maps.org/"">MAPS</a>). MAPS is led by Rick Doblin, who Nadelmann stated is the outstanding advocate for legitimizing and funding psychedelics research. He noted that MAPS is doing smart work.</li>
	<li><a href=""http://www.leap.cc/"">Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP).</a> Nadelmann described Executive Director Neill Franklin as an effective leader and a powerful speaker.</li>
	<li><a href=""http://leadkingcounty.org/"">Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD).</a> Funders such as OSF and Ford Foundation have been very supportive of this model. It was pioneered in Seattle, and DPA is now involved in the effort to replicate it in Santa Fe, NM. Representatives of other major cities have visited LEAD to consider the possibility of implementing the model back home.</li>
	<li><a href=""http://sdpconference.info/"">Samuel DeWitt Proctor Conference</a>. Iva Carruthers is a courageous leader who fully embraces drug policy reform and has been bold in advocating for the DPA agenda among her membership of largely African American clergy.</li>
</ol>

<p>One important general funding opportunity is to support innovative studies that the government will not fund. Subjects include heroin maintenance, injection sites, and other cutting-edge reform and harm reduction efforts. DPA would also encourage researchers to submit proposals to federal agencies on controversial subjects.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Current Challenges</h2>

<p>Consistent with the information above, one of the biggest organizational challenges for DPA is advancing a harm reduction and decriminalization approach for people addicted to drugs or otherwise engaged in heavy drug use&mdash;the five to 10 million people in America driving most of the drug market. DPA considers this to be the core challenge for the next generation of drug policy reformers, especially because this is such a difficult and underfunded issue. While he is optimistic about prospects for marijuana legalization, Nadelmann cautions that marijuana is not going to legalize itself, and that we have to guard against overconfidence and other risks. He is also confident that the incarceration rate will continue to decline, but since current levels are so incredibly high, we&rsquo;re a long way from DPA&rsquo;s objective to &ldquo;make America average.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<p>As previously discussed elsewhere, there are no outstanding concerns regarding the ongoing funding of DPA&rsquo;s work. Nadelmann was able to very clearly articulate DPA&rsquo;s goals and priorities during this meeting. He also noted the spaces in which DPA did not work, or would not emphasize, providing more clarity about strategies and guideposts. Nadelmann was also helpfully candid in discussing the state of the field, the challenges past and present, and what is needed to make progress.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Appendix A: Guiding Questions for Site Visit</h2>

<p>Questions used to focus the conversation included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>How will DPA&rsquo;s work change as a result of the Washington and Colorado initiatives? What are the top organizational priorities around implementation and new campaigns in 2014? Where does active/public support of pro-reform political candidates fit into this priority list?</li>
	<li>Is DPA playing a role in the creation of commercial markets for marijuana and the regulation and organization of those markets? Why or why not? Please address the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Where does commercial market creation and regulation fall within DPA&rsquo;s priorities (for itself or for support of other organizations)?</li>
		<li>If DPA does not actively engage in this work, but supports others: Who is supported, how are they supported, and what do they contribute to the field?</li>
		<li>In your opinion, how will this industry take shape? What are the power issues at play? What are potential risks and issues for backlash?</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>What is DPA&rsquo;s role in campaigns for the legalization of other drugs (such as MDMA, heroine, psilocybin, etc.)? Please be as specific as possible about what DPA is/is not committed to doing or considering in the short-term. How does this effort fit into overall priorities for the organization?</li>
	<li>Where do programs that involve a mixture of enforcement and social services support fall within DPA&rsquo;s agenda? Do you work with organizations that advance this approach? If yes, who? If not, why not?</li>
	<li>Aside from DPA, which organizations in the field of drug policy reform would use additional funding most productively?</li>
	<li>Talk about the impact that the loss of Peter Lewis will have on the field from both a financial and leadership perspective.</li>

"375","Our Writeup of Criminal Justice Reform","<p><em>Throughout the post, &ldquo;we&rdquo; refers to GiveWell and Good Ventures, who work as partners on the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/introducing-the-open-philanthropy-project"">Open Philanthropy Project</a>, previously known as GiveWell Labs.</em></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve just published an&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givewell.org/node/2294"">extensive writeup on the cause of U.S. criminal justice reform</a>, which was one of the causes we&nbsp;<a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2013/09/26/givewell-labs-update-2/"">previously listed</a>&nbsp;as a priority for investigation under&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givewell.org/givewell-labs"">GiveWell Labs</a>.</p>

<p>We first became interested in this cause when our&nbsp;<a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2013/10/24/exploring-policy-oriented-philanthropy/"">initial conversations around promising policy areas</a>&nbsp;(in particular, our&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Teles%206-12-13%20(public).pdf"">extended conversation with Steve Teles</a>) highlighted it as having unusual&nbsp;<strong>political tractability</strong>. We heard from multiple sources that the combination of the adverse U.S. fiscal situation, low crime rates, and emerging conservative interest in an issue historically supported by progressives may have created a &ldquo;unique moment&rdquo; for criminal justice reform with a limited window.</p>

<p>Due to the significant amount of suffering and expense associated with incarceration, we believe there are&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givewell.org/node/2294#Howmuchofanimpactcouldwehave"">high humanitarian stakes as well.</a>&nbsp;And in initial conversations about the cause, we identified some approaches that we believe to have relatively little in the way of philanthropic support.</p>

<p>There are other causes that we see as having higher humanitarian stakes than criminal justice reform, and other causes that we see as being more philanthropically &ldquo;neglected,&rdquo; but such causes generally don&rsquo;t have the same &ldquo;window of opportunity&rdquo; dynamic. So criminal justice reform is a plausible, though not the only plausible, candidate for &ldquo;outstanding cause to work on.&rdquo;{footnote_1}</p>

<p>When we started doing&nbsp;<a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2013/10/10/deep-investigations-of-new-causes/"">deep investigations of new causes</a>, we chose to work on criminal justice reform first, because we had multiple leads already for potential grantees, and it seemed like a cause that we would quickly learn about and make progress on from the standpoint of finding giving opportunities. Since then, we have had many conversations and identified&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givewell.org/node/2294#Whathavewedonesofar"">initial grantees that we find quite promising</a>. These grantees&rsquo; activities include research, technical assistance and advocacy. They are taking what we see as promising approaches to reducing incarceration while preserving or improving public safety (and have substantial&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/scalability"">room for more funding</a>).</p>

<p>We have paused work on this cause for the time being as we investigate other potential focus areas (more in future posts). However, we think it is quite likely that we will end up declaring criminal justice reform as an ongoing priority for&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givewell.org/givewell-labs"">GiveWell Labs</a>.</p>

<p>Much more information at our full writeup:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.givewell.org/node/2294"">Our writeup on criminal justice reform</a></p>
","<p>To put this in &ldquo;cost-effectiveness analysis&rdquo; terms: the &ldquo;window of opportunity&rdquo; aspect implies that chances for influencing policy are unusually high in this domain; our&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givewell.org/node/2294#Howmuchofanimpactcouldwehave"">analysis of potential policy impacts</a>&nbsp;implies that such influence would have high humanitarian value; the fact that there is little existing philanthropic support for what we consider promising approaches implies that more funding could make a difference. Thus, speaking broadly, the prospects for high impact per dollar spent seem relatively strong. Future posts will compare this cause more explicitly with other potential policy causes. As&nbsp;<a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/06/the-track-record-of-policy-oriented-philanthropy/"">discussed previously</a>, we believe that estimating the cost-effectiveness of policy-oriented philanthropy is particularly challenging, but that there are initial reasons to believe that it can be quite high relative to other styles of philanthropy.</p>

"322","Our Giving Season Plans","<p>This giving season we&rsquo;re excited to offer $5 million in matching funds for donations to GiveDirectly from December 3, 2013 through January 31, 2014. All donations to GiveDirectly, up to $100,000 per donor, will be counted toward the match. The funds are intended to help GiveDirectly attract new donors and reach its goal of transferring tens of millions of dollars to extremely poor households in developing countries over the next few years.</p>

<p>(UPDATE: GiveDirectly&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givedirectly.org/blog_post.php?id=4778983911622303272"">successfully raised more than $5 million</a>&nbsp;between December 3 and January 31, meaning Good Ventures will award the full matching grant.)</p>

Information on how to donate to GiveDirectly can be found <a href=""https://www.givedirectly.org/give.php"">here</a>. Read on for more details about the match and why we think GiveDirectly represents an excellent giving opportunity.</span></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re also happy to announce the following grants to GiveDirectly, the Deworm the World Initiative and the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, in recognition of GiveWell&rsquo;s <a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/01/givewells-top-charities-for-giving-season-2013/"">charity recommendations for 2013</a>:</p>

</ul>

<p>These grants are intended to cover around 75% of the <a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/01/givewells-top-charities-for-giving-season-2013/"">minimum level of funding that GiveWell would like to see its recommended charities raise</a> during the 2013 giving season. GiveWell&rsquo;s reviews of GiveDirectly, the Deworm the World Initiative and the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative are available <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities"">here</a>. Read on for more details about the rationale behind these grants.</p>

<h2>Matching funds for GiveDirectly</h2>

<p>Donating to GiveDirectly is an excellent opportunity, both to empower poor people to improve their lives and to help a young and impressive organization scale up a promising tool for development: unrestricted cash transfers.</p>

<p>GiveDirectly transfers cash to extremely low-income households in Kenya and Uganda, no strings attached. Its program appears to have substantial near-term benefits for the individuals and families who receive the transfers. Says GiveWell: &ldquo;Strong evidence indicates that cash transfers lead recipients to spend more on their basic needs (such as food) and may allow recipients to make investments with high returns, with no evidence of large increases in spending on items like alcohol or tobacco.&rdquo; For more, see <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly"">GiveWell&rsquo;s review of GiveDirectly</a> and <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers"">report on cash transfers</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to these direct, near-term benefits, supporting GiveDirectly offers significant potential for leverage. We&rsquo;re excited about the notion of cash transfers becoming a standard of comparison for other development interventions. In other words, we&rsquo;d like to see more donors and charities asking, &ldquo;Does this program do more good for the intended beneficiaries than giving them the cost of the program in cash?&rdquo; Helping GiveDirectly to hone and scale its model contributes to that goal. What&rsquo;s more, supporting charities such as GiveDirectly that are highly transparent and self-reflective increases the incentive for other charities to act in similar ways.</p>

<p>The matching funds are intended to help GiveDirectly attract new donors and reach its goal of transferring tens of millions of dollars to extremely poor households in developing countries over the next few years. Good Ventures will match donations of up to $100,000 per donor made to GiveDirectly from December 3, 2013 through January 31, 2014 (regardless of whether they are attributable to GiveWell&rsquo;s recommendation),&nbsp;up to $5 million total.</p>

<p>We think it&rsquo;s important for GiveDirectly to build a broad base of supporters rather than relying heavily on a few large donors in order to ensure its long-term sustainability. Our explicit aim in offering the matching funds is to help GiveDirectly attract new individual donors, and the funds will be committed only if matching donations are made. (In other words, these are &ldquo;true&rdquo; matching funds. For more on the topic of &ldquo;illusory matching,&rdquo; see <a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/15/why-you-shouldnt-let-donation-matching-affect-your-giving/"">this post</a> by GiveWell. Our match falls in the category of &ldquo;influence matching&rdquo; described therein.) We&rsquo;re offering this match in addition to a $2 million grant to GiveDirectly; more on that below.</p>

<h2>Grants to GiveWell&rsquo;s top charities</h2>

<p>In recognition of GiveWell&rsquo;s <a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/01/givewells-top-charities-for-giving-season-2013/"">charity recommendations for 2013</a>, we&rsquo;ve awarded the following grants:</p>

<ul>
	<li>$2 million to GiveDirectly (in addition to the above-mentioned matching funds)</li>
	<li>$1.5 million to the Deworm the World Initiative</li>
	<li>$750,000 to the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</li>
</ul>

<p>GiveWell&rsquo;s reviews of GiveDirectly, the Deworm the World Initiative and the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative are available <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Below I describe the thought process that led to these grants in detail. I hope explaining our thought process helps other GiveWell followers decide how to allocate their charitable dollars this year. We&rsquo;re grateful to be a part of a community of donors who are dedicated to learning how to maximize the impact of their giving.</p>

<p>GiveWell&rsquo;s top charities represent some of the best giving opportunities we&rsquo;ve found to date. We believe that supporting them is likely to (a) do substantial good for poor people in developing countries, (b) encourage other donors to support these charities by signaling our confidence in GiveWell&rsquo;s recommendations, and (c) reinforce the importance of qualities such as transparency and self-reflection among charitable organizations. We also have a bias for &ldquo;giving early&rdquo; because we believe that the good we do by giving today will compound over time. At the same time, we believe we (and GiveWell) are likely to find substantially better giving opportunities in the future, and we want to leave room for other donors to support GiveWell&rsquo;s recommended charities. We believe it&rsquo;s important for the charities to build a broad base of supporters, and that encouraging others to give annually will lead to more total giving in the long run.</p>

<p>Weighing these considerations against each other, we&rsquo;ve sought to cover around 75% of the <a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/01/givewells-top-charities-for-giving-season-2013/"">minimum level of funding that GiveWell would like to see its recommended charities raise</a> during the 2013 giving season, and we expect other donations to fill the rest of the gap.</p>

<p>How much of the funding gaps to fill was a tough call. In a world where the other donors interested in supporting GiveWell&rsquo;s recommended charities comprised a small number of major funders, we&rsquo;d aim to have a conversation with them about how to divide the funding gaps. But negotiating with the large number of individual donors who are likely to follow GiveWell&rsquo;s recommendations isn&rsquo;t feasible.</p>

<p>We briefly considered &ldquo;topping up&rdquo; donations received by GiveWell&rsquo;s recommended charities after the giving season. In other words, we could wait until January to see how much the charities raise from individuals, and then we could make grants to ensure that the &ldquo;minimum targets&rdquo; set by GiveWell are reached. For example, if the Deworm the World Initiative were to raise $1.2 million out of GiveWell&rsquo;s $2 million target, we could provide the other $800,000.</p>

<p>We decided against this approach because it could be perceived as &ldquo;canceling out&rdquo; the decisions of other donors. If we took the &ldquo;top up&rdquo; approach, an individual donor&rsquo;s $1,000 gift to a recommended charity would cause us to give that much less to the same charity (up to the point where the minimum target was reached). That could be perceived as a transfer of value from the individual donor to Good Ventures, rather than the charity. Such a dynamic would make us uncomfortable, so we decided to avoid it.</p>

<p>Instead of waiting to see how much individual donors give and adjusting our grantmaking accordingly, we&rsquo;ve made a conservative prediction about how individuals will act and, taking that into account, awarded grants aimed at ensuring GiveWell and its recommended charities meet their minimum goals. We&rsquo;re announcing our grants upfront and committing not to &ldquo;top up&rdquo; donations if the charities don&rsquo;t raise enough to reach GiveWell&rsquo;s targets. We hope doing so helps other GiveWell followers decide how to allocate their charitable dollars this giving season.</p>
","<p>The Deworm the World Initiative is led by Evidence Action.

"288","An Update on Our Grant to Population Services International Myanmar","<p>This post gives an update on the <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grants/containment-of-artemisinin-resistance-in-eastern-myanmar-august-2012"">Containment of Artemisinin Resistance in Eastern Myanmar</a> project, which is being carried out by Population Services International (PSI) and&nbsp;was recommended to us by the Gates Foundation. We&nbsp;contributed to this project&nbsp;as part of <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/co-funding-with-the-gates-foundation"">our effort to learn from major foundations by co-funding projects</a> with them.<em> Note:&nbsp;This update reflects the progress of the project as of September 2012. Information on recent progress of this project is forthcoming.</em></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In August 2012, Good Ventures made a $1 million grant to PSI Myanmar to support the&nbsp;Containment of Artemisinin Resistance in Eastern Myanmar project, which is primarily funded by the UK&nbsp;Department for International Development&nbsp;(DFID) and the Gates Foundation.&nbsp;Our <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/PSI-Myanmar-Artemisinin-Resistance-Containment/"">last update</a> (published in September 2012 by GiveWell) laid out this project&#39;s plans for implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and room for more funding. This page summarizes major project developments through September&nbsp;2012. This project aims to increase use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) to treat malaria and reduce the use of artemisinin-based monotherapy (AMT) in order to prevent the development of drug resistance. The project has progressed slower than originally anticipated due to multiple factors discussed below, though project progress appears to have accelerated toward the end of 2012, and we don&#39;t see the speed of progress as a cause for concern at this time. We are not yet in a position to report on the project&#39;s likelihood of achieving its goals.</p>

<h2>Project progress</h2>

<p>In the first half of 2012, the project made slower progress than originally anticipated in the project plan, primarily due to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Delayed signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Myanmar. The memorandum of understanding has now been signed.{footnote_1}</li>
	<li>PSI replaced its country representative in Myanmar in the summer of 2012.{footnote_2}</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not see either of these issues as cause for concern. In the second half of 2012, PSI made more progress, including packaging and selling the first batches of subsidized ACT to its partner company,{footnote_3}<fn>&nbsp;</fn>and completing baseline surveys (some of which were, as of January 2013, still being analyzed).{footnote_4}</p>

<p><fn></fn>In the summer of 2012, PSI discovered that only one AMT (Artesunate), which is supplied by the company PSI has partnered with to supply ACT, had been banned. Artemether, a second AMT supplied by another company, had not been banned. This led Artemether to gain significant market share and PSI&#39;s partner to lose market share. As a result, PSI was concerned that sales of its ACT, which came onto the market in October 2012, might be slower than expected.{footnote_5}</p>

<p>PSI convened a meeting in August 2012 that resulted in a ban of the alternative AMT.{footnote_6}</p>

<h2>Room for more funding</h2>

<p>When Good Ventures provided funding to this project in August 2012, we believed that it had significant room for more funding. We thought that the project needed funding to meet its goals and without additional funding it would fall short. Throughout the course of 2012, we learned that PSI&#39;s future financial needs for this project could not be projected with sufficient precision to know whether or not it had needed (or would need) additional funds.{footnote_7}</p>

","<p>&quot;The most critical challenge for this reporting period has been the impact of a delayed MoU with the GoM, although PSI worked hard to accelerate activity once the MOU was obtained.&quot; PSI progress report form for the Gates Foundation (December 2012).</p>
|<p>&quot;Linked to the delay in securing a MoU, PSI has had to deal with a transition in organizational leadership in Yangon with a new Country Representative, Barry Whittle, joining the office in the summer of 2012. This undoubtedly hampered managerial capacity for a few months during the reporting period.&quot; PSI progress report form for the Gates Foundation (December 2012).&nbsp;</p>
|<p>&quot;The first ACT orders were delivered to AA in the last month of this reporting period (September 2012). A table summarizing orders by AA to date, and their reported sales is attached (Annex 3).&quot; PSI progress report form for the Gates Foundation (December 2012).</p>
|<p>&quot;A nationally representative household survey capturing treatment-seeking behavior and use of antimalarial drugs, as well as respondent knowledge of antimalarials, was conducted&hellip; The first annual (and therefore baseline) outlet survey has now been completed&hellip; The results from this survey, the second Household Survey and Supply Chain Assessment are currently being triangulated.&quot; PSI progress report form for the Gates Foundation (December 2012).</p>
|<p>&quot;At the start of the project, a rapid antimalarial supply chain assessment (conducted in three areas of eastern Myanmar) suggested that one company, AA Medical Products Ltd (AA), dominated the market, accounting for around 70% of all AMT national sales. In short, the antimalarial market seemed remarkably centralized. Until very recently, AA&rsquo;s main antimalarial product has been oral Artesunate (at the time of project start up, this product was by far the most common at all levels of the private sector supply chain). The drug passed international quality standards and was imported legitimately with Myanmar&rsquo;s Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) approval. AA were not aware that oral AMT posed a serious threat to global malaria control efforts (and presumably nor were the FDA at that time). With support and guidance from the World Health Organization, the FDA later moved to ban further importation of oral Artesunate by pharmaceutical distributors, including AA. In early 2012, PSI and AA signed an agreement whereby PSI (with donor funding) would supply AA with highly subsidized quality assured ACT to replace oral AMT throughout Myanmar (the subsidy offsetting the cost difference between partial courses of oral AMT and a full course of quality assured ACT). As a result of AA&rsquo;s dominance in the market, a rapid change in AMT availability versus ACT was anticipated, with an estimated 9 million courses of ACT being sold over three years. PSI&rsquo;s first annual Private Sector Outlet Survey was completed in early 2012 (with analysis completed by October). The purpose of the annual outlet surveys is to identify and monitor trends in the availability, price and relative volumes of antimalarial drugs across a nationally representative sample of private sector outlets throughout eastern Myanmar. Of 3,658 outlets visited, 1,274 were deemed eligible and able to participate in the process. The baseline Outlet Survey revealed that not only had Artesunate lost market share relative to Artemether when compared with the rapid supply chain results (60% for Artesunate versus 40% for Artemether), but also AA&rsquo;s products (mainly Artesunate and some Artemether) now represented only 34% of the total AMT market. More recent information now being analyzed from a full Supply Chain Assessment suggests this share has now diminished significantly, to approximately 2.3%. While a reduction in the availability of AA&rsquo;s Artesunate (and Artemether) was to be expected following the FDA ban on future importation, it was unclear at the time why Artemether would gain market share relative to Artesunate if also banned. The answer to this question emerged at the mid-2012 annual partner&rsquo;s review meeting of the Myanmar Artemisinin Resistance Containment (MARC) framework, where it transpired that not all oral AMT importation had been banned by the FDA. At that time, only Artesunate (AA&rsquo;s main product) had been banned. The second AMT identified by PSI during the rapid supply chain assessment of 2011- Artemether &ndash; was therefore gaining market share relative to Artesunate as a result of the partial AMT ban by the FDA (Note: AA were not yet being supplied with quality assured and subsidized ACT to replace their dominant AMT, resulting in a supply gap that was clearly being filled by competitors with an alternative AMT).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The first ACT orders were delivered to AA in the last month of this reporting period (September 2012).&quot; PSI progress report form for the Gates Foundation (December 2012).</p>
|<p>&quot;The meeting successfully concluded with the FDA publicly stating that oral Artemether monotherapy was also now banned, but it remains unclear as to how well this has been communicated to the major importers of this product, despite encouraging field observations suggesting that this AMT is already becoming scarce in the supply chain.&quot; PSI progress report form for the Gates Foundation (December 2012).</p>
|<p>&quot;An ongoing challenge and learning has been the degree of flexibility and nimbleness needed by PSI in order to handle the highly volatile and unpredictable operational and policy environment. For example, the team does not yet know how much decentralization of health in Myanmar will help or hinder roll out of the project. This will be closely monitored and likely require shifts in and updates in how the project operates or how it operates in some areas. Forecasting demand for ACTs and RDTs (the main cost drivers of the project) is also an ongoing challenge and learning.&quot;&nbsp;PSI progress report form for the Gates Foundation (December 2012).</p>

"243","Learning Grants in Policy Advocacy","<p>One of our long-term goals is to learn about policy advocacy&mdash;a common form of activity supported by philanthropy. Funding advocacy seems more complicated, riskier and potentially more controversial than giving to support the delivery of cheap, proven interventions such as bednets, vaccines or cash transfers to poor people in developing countries. Yet many of the largest foundations and funders whose work we find most interesting support policy advocacy. Given the influence of public policy on people&rsquo;s lives and the magnitude of government spending worldwide, advocacy could be among the most leveraged philanthropic activities. So we&rsquo;re taking steps to learn about how policy advocacy works and giving opportunities in this realm.</p>

<h2>Learning Grants</h2>

<p>Right now, we know relatively little about how philanthropy influences policy. So in 2012, we made a few &ldquo;learning grants&rdquo; in policy advocacy, in support of causes we find compelling &mdash; drug policy reform and marriage equality &mdash; as a way to start learning about what advocacy organizations do, what makes them effective and how to evaluate their impact.</p>

<p>By learning grants, we mean grants made after undertaking basic but not extensive due diligence to organizations working on causes we find promising, in the hopes of learning more post-grant.</p>

<p>Why give grants in order to learn? A lot of the most valuable knowledge is informal (i.e. not easily captured by reviewing documents) and best captured by spending time talking to the people involved. We&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s easier to have these conversations when we&#39;re able to approach people as supporters. The organizations we&rsquo;ve supported to date have been extremely open and accessible to us. Our grants show that we&#39;re serious about a cause and that talking to us is worthwhile. Experienced staff at other major foundations also have encouraged us to make learning grants for this reason.</p>

<p>We decided to start with drug policy reform and marriage equality for a few reasons. First off, we are interested in these causes and see great potential for improving lives by working on them. Both offered timely learning opportunities, with multiple initiatives for marijuana legalization and marriage equality appearing on state ballots in November 2012. Lastly, we already had strong access to organizations and funders working in these fields. Throughout this post we share our impressions about why these causes are promising, though we also recognize that we still have a lot to learn.</p>

<p>In addition to these learning grants, we&rsquo;re working with GiveWell to investigate other promising policy-related causes.</p>

<h2>Drug Policy Reform</h2>

<p>Broadly speaking, the goal of organizations working on this cause is to change drug-related policies in the U.S. and abroad to be less punitive, more rational and evidenced-based, and more focused on improving public health and respecting personal freedom. We think the effects of reforming drug policy and increasing access to treatment for drug abusers &mdash; e.g. reducing incarceration, curbing drug abuse, and reducing violence and crime associated with drug sales and trafficking &mdash; could be hugely impactful.</p>

<p>Other factors that make this cause promising: There seems to be growing support for drug policy reform. Yet the movement is still relatively nascent and underfunded, possibly because the cause traditionally has been considered taboo. It&rsquo;s also an area in which the central questions &mdash; e.g. what are the best ways to reduce drug-related crime, drug abuse and addiction? &mdash; can be studied and meaningful evidence can be generated to inform policymaking. (However, our impression is that there&rsquo;s currently relatively little high-quality evidence on these issues.)</p>

<p>We made our first learning grant in drug policy reform to the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA), a nonprofit which promotes policies aimed at reducing the harms of drug prohibition and drug use, such as legalizing marijuana, reducing criminal penalties and arrests for marijuana possession, and increasing the availability of counseling and treatment for drug addicts. We selected the DPA based on our impression that it is the leading nonprofit working on drug policy reform. That impression was based on our prior knowledge of the field, conversations with DPA founder and executive director Ethan Nadelmann, and conversations with representatives of two other major funders of drug policy reform. (A more recent conversation with Andy Ko of the Open Society Foundations&rsquo; Campaign for a New Drug Policy &mdash; notes from which are available <a href=""http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/conversations/open-society-foundations-drug-policy-november-19-2012"">here</a> &mdash; confirmed this impression.) We made a $150,000 grant for general operating support to the DPA in June 2012.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, we hired independent consultants to landscape the field of drug policy reform, evaluate whether the DPA is the most effective organization working on this cause and suggest opportunities for future investigation and grantmaking. That evaluation is ongoing.</p>

<h2>Marriage Equality</h2>

<p>The second policy-related cause we chose to support last year was marriage equality, partly because the 2012 election represented an opportunity to legalize same-sex marriage in additional states before the Supreme Court hears a case on this issue.</p>

<p>We made our first learning grants in marriage equality to Freedom To Marry, a nonprofit that promotes the right of same-sex couples to marry in the U.S. Freedom to Marry&rsquo;s goals include overturning the Defense of Marriage Act and winning the right for same-sex couples to marry in more U.S. states. We selected Freedom to Marry based on the recommendation of Sean Eldridge, a senior advisor at Freedom to Marry, who is a donor to several organizations that advocate for LGBT rights, and whom we trust and view as particularly knowledgeable about and invested in this cause. (Sean is the husband of Chris Hughes, who co-founded Facebook with Good Ventures Co-Founder Dustin Moskovitz in 2004.) In June 2012 we made a $150,000 grant for general operating support to Freedom to Marry. In September, we supported the Silicon Valley Community Foundation (SVCF) to make a $100,000 grant to Freedom to Marry Action &mdash; Freedom to Marry&rsquo;s advocacy and political arm &mdash; to buy advertisements for the campaign to legalize same-sex marriage in Maine.&#123;footnote_1&#125;&nbsp;In November, we were gratified to see Maine voters approve a ballot initiative to legalize same-sex marriage, making Maine one of the first three states to legalize same-sex marriage via popular vote.&#123;footnote_2&#125;</p>
","<p>501(c)(3) nonprofits are subject to limits on legislative lobbying and prohibited from certain kinds of political activity, such as campaigning for or against candidates for public office.

Freedom to Marry is a 501(c)(3) whereas Freedom to Marry Action is a 501(c)(4). Good Ventures is not able to support 501(c)(4)s on its own, so we supported SVCF to fund Freedom to Marry Action, since same-sex marriage is a cause that SVCF also supports. <a href=""http://bolderadvocacy.org/navigate-the-rules/types-of-organizations"">This page from the Alliance for Justice</a> has more information about the different types of nonprofit organizations and which advocacy and political activities they are allowed to engage in.</p>
